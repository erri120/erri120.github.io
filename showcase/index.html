My <a href=https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/commit/b41902815d4757db18ba997a564eac929cb15b9a>first commit</a> was from Sep 2019 and is a classic non-code no-functionality first commit that changes a few names and fixes typos. Early 2020 was when I made the most commits and when Wabbajack underwent a lot of changes because it had only been around since July 2019.</p><p>Wabbajack was more than just an Application and we quickly found ourselves in need of a website which I started work on in October 2019. The very old code is even still on <a href=https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack-tools.github.io-old>GitHub</a>. The website has been a pain point for me and underwent way too many iterations. It began it&rsquo;s life as a JavaScript React-Redux SPA using Material-UI, then went from JavaScript to TypeScript, I switched Redux with MobX and is now using Blazor. You can find the code <a href=https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack-tools.github.io>here</a>.</p><p>My programming journey has been shaped by Wabbajack, it was the reason I started learning C# and Web-Development and you can clearly see that by following my commits. It was a learning experience and something I am very proud the be a part of.</p></div></div></article><hr><div style=margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:8px;display:flex;justify-content:center><script type=text/javascript src=https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/widget/Widget_2.js></script><script type=text/javascript>kofiwidget2.init("Support Me on Ko-fi","#29abe0","P5P03UIPI"),kofiwidget2.draw()</script></div><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=erri120/erri120.github.io issue-term=pathname label=site-comment theme=github-dark-orange crossorigin=anonymous async></script></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user"><span>CC BY 4.0</span>
