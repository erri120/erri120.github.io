# erri120.github.io

Code for my small site hosted on GitHub Pages. This is the master branch that contains the actual source, the actual static files can be found on the [gh-pages](https://github.com/erri120/erri120.github.io/tree/gh-pages) branch.

As for the site itself: I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with a modified version of the [terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) theme by [panr](https://twitter.com/panr) that can be found [here](https://github.com/erri120/hugo-theme-terminal).
