<h2 id=about-me>About Me<a href=#about-me class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a> </h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a random dude who loves music, videogames, programming and playing the piano.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been the description of most of my online accounts for quite a long time and it&rsquo;s still true. All four parts are integral to my life and probably will stay that way till the end of my journey.</p>
<p>I started programming in 2011/2012 with Java because Minecraft was the hottest thing back then and you had to use Java to create plugins and mods. Minecraft also taught me how to set up a server and what goes into hosting one. 10 years later and learning by doing is still my preferred way. I did not start with low level C/C++, how pointers work, how to use <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>, I just tried to create something I want to use and learned how to program while doing so.</p>
<p>This even goes into my piano practice: I taught myself how to play the piano, I did not had a teacher and I just play for myself. When I find a new song I want to play, I just play it. No analysis, no in-depth planning or anything, just pure mechanics. Classically trained pianists will be disgusted by this method but it works for me and I&rsquo;ve been doing it ever since we bought the DGX-650 in 2015.</p>
