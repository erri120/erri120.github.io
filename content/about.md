Hi! Thanks for somehow ending up on this blog. I rarely create a post and when I do it's often about the most random things I find interesting. Please let me know how you ended up on this site, looking at the lack of activity on my Google Search Console page I can assume you got the link from someone and did not found this site using a search engine.

## About Me

> I'm a random dude who loves music, videogames, programming and playing the piano.

This has been the description of most of my online accounts for quite a long time and it's still true. All four parts are integral to my life and probably will stay that way till the end of my journey.

I started programming in 2011/2012 with Java because Minecraft was the hottest thing back then and you had to use Java to create plugins and mods. Minecraft also taught me how to set up a server and what goes into hosting one. 10 years later and learning by doing is still my preferred way. I did not start with low level C/C++, how pointers work, how to use `malloc` and `free`, I just tried to create something I want to use and learned how to program while doing so.

This even goes into my piano practice: I taught myself how to play the piano, I did not had a teacher and I just play for myself. When I find a new song I want to play, I just play it. No analysis, no in-depth planning or anything, just pure mechanics. Classically trained pianists will be disgusted by this method but it works for me and I've been doing it ever since we bought the DGX-650 in 2015.
