A collection of some of the neat things I created or worked on.

## Wabbajack and the Bethesda Modding Community

Definitely the biggest open-source project I've worked on. [Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack) has nearly 60 thousand members in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Wabbajack), at the time of writing, and we successfully changed the way you mod your game. My [first commit](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/commit/b41902815d4757db18ba997a564eac929cb15b9a) was from Sep 2019 and is a classic non-code no-functionality first commit that changes a few names and fixes typos. Early 2020 was when I made the most commits and when Wabbajack underwent a lot of changes because it had only been around since July 2019.

Wabbajack was more than just an Application and we quickly found ourselves in need of a website which I started work on in October 2019. The very old code is even still on [GitHub](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack-tools.github.io-old). The website has been a pain point for me and underwent way too many iterations. It began it's life as a JavaScript React-Redux SPA using Material-UI, then went from JavaScript to TypeScript, I switched Redux with MobX and is now using Blazor. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack-tools.github.io).

My programming journey has been shaped by Wabbajack, it was the reason I started learning C# and Web-Development and you can clearly see that by following my commits. It was a learning experience and something I am very proud the be a part of.
