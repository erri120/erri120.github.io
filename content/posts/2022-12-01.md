[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an advent calendar of programming puzzles. Starting on December 1st and ending on December 25th, you will get a puzzle every day and have to solve it. This is the 8th time the event happened, and I will be documenting my solutions here. The code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/erri120/advent-of-code-2022).

## Part One

{{< details Description >}}
The jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves' expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of **Calories** each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).

The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.

For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:

```text
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
```

This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:

- The first Elf is carrying food with `1000`, `2000`, and `3000` Calories, a total of **`6000`** Calories.
- The second Elf is carrying one food item with **`4000`** Calories.
- The third Elf is carrying food with `5000` and `6000` Calories, a total of **`11000`** Calories.
- The fourth Elf is carrying food with `7000`, `8000`, and `9000` Calories, a total of **`24000`** Calories.
- The fifth Elf is carrying one food item with **`10000`** Calories.

In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the **most** Calories. In the example above, this is **`24000`** (carried by the fourth Elf).

Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. **How many total Calories is that Elf carrying**?

The first puzzle of the event has always been the easiest, but difficulty will ramp up in later puzzles. For now, we are given a text file and need to do some additions. I have chosen to go with C# for this puzzle because LINQ is really powerful and ideal for this situation.

Let's start with a _naive_ approach to the problem:

- read the text file
- iterate over every line
- for each line:
    - add number to counter
    - if the line is empty:
        - add the current counter value to a list
        - reset the counter to 0
- take the biggest value of the list as a solution

In C# the implementation would look something like this:

```csharp
var contents = await File.ReadAllLinesAsync("input.txt", Encoding.UTF8);

var elves = new List<int>();
var currentCalories = 0;

foreach (var line in contents)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(line))
    {
        elves.Add(currentCalories);
        currentCalories = 0;
        continue;
    }

    var calories = int.Parse(line);
    currentCalories += calories;
}

Console.WriteLine($"Elf with most Calories: {elves.Max()}");
```

The LINQ extension method [`Enumerable.Max`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.max) returns the maximum value in a sequence of values which is exactly what we need for the puzzle. While this solution works and is easy to understand, we can make it more concise and fully utilize LINQ:

```csharp
var mostCalories = (await File.ReadAllTextAsync("input.txt", Encoding.UTF8))
    .Split("\n\n")
    .Select(chunk => chunk
        .Split('\n', StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries)
        .Select(line => int.Parse(line))
        .Sum())
    .Max();

Console.WriteLine($"Elf with most Calories: {mostCalories}");
```

Instead of using [`ReadAllLinesAsync`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.file.readalllinesasync) which returns all lines in a string array `string[]`, we can use [`ReadAllTextAsync`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.file.readalltextasync) and use [`String.Split`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.split) to create chunks of the input. Remember that each elf is separated by an empty line, so we can split at `\n\n` to create the chunks we need.

After the split we now have an enumerable sequence of chunks (`IEnumerable<string>`) which we need to project into something different. The [`Enumerable.Select`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.select) does exactly that. The `chunk` variable within the lambda will look something like this:

```text
1000
2000
4000
```

With another use of `String.Split` we create a sequence of lines where we use `Enumerable.Select` to parse `1000` into an integer. Finally, we use [`Enumerable.Sum`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.sum) to compute the sum of the sequence because we don't want a sequence of calories for each elf but the total calories each elf is carrying.

To answer the question of how many total calories the elf with the most calories is carrying we can use `Enumerable.Max` to get the maximum value. This solution showcases the power of LINQ and how you can get very creative with it.

## Part Two

{{< details Description >}}
By the time you calculate the answer to the Elves' question, they've already realized that the Elf carrying the most Calories of food might eventually **run out of snacks**.

To avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would instead like to know the total Calories carried by the **top three** Elves carrying the most Calories. That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they still have two backups.

In the example above, the top three Elves are the fourth Elf (with `24000` Calories), then the third Elf (with `11000` Calories), then the fifth Elf (with `10000` Calories). The sum of the Calories carried by these three elves is **`45000`**.

Find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. **How many Calories are those Elves carrying in total**?
{{< /details >}}

Most puzzles in the event will consists of multiple parts. These parts always require the previous solution before being accessible and only require minor code changes. With our LINQ solution we only need to change a little:

```csharp
var elves = (await File.ReadAllTextAsync("input.txt", Encoding.UTF8))
    .Split("\n\n")
    .Select(chunk => chunk
        .Split('\n', StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries)
        .Select(line => int.Parse(line))
        .Sum())
    .Order()
    .ToArray();

Console.WriteLine($"Elf with most Calories: {elves.Last()}");
Console.WriteLine($"Top 3 Elves combined: {elves.TakeLast(3).Sum()}");
```

Instead of only getting the maximum total calories, we also want the combined total calories of the top 3 elves. Since we already have the total calories of each elf, we just need to order the sequence and take the biggest values. Note that [`Enumerable.Order`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.order) sorts the elements in **ascending order** meaning the biggest values are **last**. This is why we need to use [`Enumerable.Last`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.last) to get the last element and [`Enumerable.TakeLast`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.takelast) to get the last 3 values which are the 3 biggest ones.

## Conclusion

This is just the first and easiest puzzle from the event and a good puzzle for people getting started with programming. It will be interesting to see how hard future puzzles will become.
