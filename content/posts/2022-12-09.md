## Part One

{{< details Description >}}
This rope bridge creaks as you walk along it. You aren't sure how old it is, or whether it can even support your weight.

It seems to support the Elves just fine, though. The bridge spans a gorge which was carved out by the massive river far below you.

You step carefully; as you do, the ropes stretch and twist. You decide to distract yourself by modeling rope physics; maybe you can even figure out where **not** to step.

Consider a rope with a knot at each end; these knots mark the **head** and the **tail** of the rope. If the head moves far enough away from the tail, the tail is pulled toward the head.

Due to nebulous reasoning involving [Planck lengths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units#Planck_length), you should be able to model the positions of the knots on a two-dimensional grid. Then, by following a hypothetical **series of motions** (your puzzle input) for the head, you can determine how the tail will move.

Due to the aforementioned Planck lengths, the rope must be quite short; in fact, the head (`H`) and tail (`T`) must **always be touching** (diagonally adjacent and even overlapping both count as touching):

```text
....
.TH.
....

....
.H..
..T.
....

...
.H. (H covers T)
...
```

If the head is ever two steps directly up, down, left, or right from the tail, the tail must also move one step in that direction so it remains close enough:

```text
.....    .....    .....
.TH.. -> .T.H. -> ..TH.
.....    .....    .....

...    ...    ...
.T.    .T.    ...
.H. -> ... -> .T.
...    .H.    .H.
...    ...    ...
```

Otherwise, if the head and tail aren't touching and aren't in the same row or column, the tail always moves one step diagonally to keep up:

```text
.....    .....    .....
.....    ..H..    ..H..
..H.. -> ..... -> ..T..
.T...    .T...    .....
.....    .....    .....

.....    .....    .....
.....    .....    .....
..H.. -> ...H. -> ..TH.
.T...    .T...    .....
.....    .....    .....
```

You just need to work out where the tail goes as the head follows a series of motions. Assume the head and the tail both start at the same position, overlapping.

For example:

```
R 4
U 4
L 3
D 1
R 4
D 1
L 5
R 2
```

This series of motions moves the head **right** four steps, then **up** four steps, then **left** three steps, then **down** one step, and so on. After each step, you'll need to update the position of the tail if the step means the head is no longer adjacent to the tail. Visually, these motions occur as follows (`s` marks the starting position as a reference point):

```text
== Initial State ==

......
......
......
......
H.....  (H covers T, s)

== R 4 ==

......

```

After simulating the rope, you can count up all of the positions the **tail visited at least once**. In this diagram, `s` again marks the starting position (which the tail also visited) and `#` marks other positions the tail visited:

So, there are **`13`** positions the tail visited at least once.

Simulate your complete hypothetical series of motions. **How many positions does the tail of the rope visit at least once?**
{{< /details>}}

If you are like and do these puzzles after waking up, then you might have to re-read the description a couple of times before understanding what's even going on. Essentially we have two points in 2D space, the head and tail position, and whenever the head moves according to the puzzle input, the tail has to follow.

Let's start by modeling our data:

```csharp
public enum Direction
{
    Right,
    Left,
    Up,
    Down
}
```

Once again I'm reaching for a [`readonly` struct](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct#readonly-struct) to store the motion data.

```csharp
public readonly struct Motion
{
    public readonly Direction Direction;
    public readonly int Steps;

    public Motion(Direction direction, int steps)
    {
        Direction = direction;
        Steps = steps;
    }

    public static Motion FromString(string line)
    {
        var sDirection = line[0];
        var direction = sDirection switch
        {
            'R' => Direction.Right,
            'L' => Direction.Left,
            'U' => Direction.Up,
            'D' => Direction.Down,
            _ => throw new UnreachableException()
        };

        var count = int.Parse(line[1..]);
        return new Motion(direction, count);
    }
}
```

Another straightforward thing we can implement right now is updating the head position:

```csharp
private static Vector2 NewHeadPosition(Vector2 current, Direction direction)
{
    return direction switch
    {
        Direction.Right => current with { X = current.X += 1 },
        Direction.Left => current with { X = current.X -= 1 },
        Direction.Up => current with { Y = current.Y += 1 },
        Direction.Down => current with { Y = current.Y -= 1 },
        _ => throw new UnreachableException()
    };
}
```

This method utilizes some cool .NET features, first I've decided to represent the positions as [`Vector2`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.vector2), there is also [`Vector3`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.vector3) and [`Vector4`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.vector4) if you need more dimensions. More interesting than that is the [switch expression](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/switch-expression) using [Pattern matching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/patterns) we got in C# 7 and 8 and the awesome new [with expression](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/with-expression) from C# 9 and C# 10. Here is how `with` works with `Vector2`:

```csharp
public void M() {
    var a = new Vector2(0, 1);
    var b = a with { X = 100 };
}

// gets converted into

public void M()
{
    Vector2 vector = new Vector2(0f, 1f);
    Vector2 vector2 = vector;
    vector2.X = 100f;
    Vector2 vector3 = vector2;
}
```

You can observe this behavior on [SharpLab](https://sharplab.io/#v2:CYLg1APgAgDABFAjAOgHIFcC2BTATgSwGMBnAbgFgAoKAZgQCY4BhOAbyrk4TqgBY4AsgAoAlGw5dJANwCGuODLgBeOADtsAdzgA1bIQAuAe1z0hMADRxEIipUnS5cAEbKFcDfn0ALNnAAarogw8AC+pHASnCFUIUA==).

Now onto the interesting part. How do we update the tail position to follow the head? Let's make a new method and think about it.

```csharp
private static Vector2 NewTailPosition(Vector2 tail, Vector2 head)
{
    // ...
}
```

The tail only has to move, if it doesn't touch the head. It can have the same position as the head or be in any adjacent field to the right, left, up, down or diagonally. We can check if the tail is next to the head by calculating the distance between the two points:

```csharp
var d1 = Vector2.Distance(a, b);
var d2 = Vector2.DistanceSquared(a, b);
```

`Vector2` has two distance methods 1) [`Vector2.Distance`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.vector2.distance) returns the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) and [`Vector2.DistanceSquared`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.vector2.distancesquared) return the [Euclidean distance squared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#Squared_Euclidean_distance). The squared distance is faster to compute and always non-negative so exactly what we want:

```csharp
var distance = Vector2.DistanceSquared(head, tail);
if (distance <= 2.0f) return tail;
```

- tail position is overlapping with the head position: distance = 0
- tail position is right, left, up or down of the head position: distance = 1
- tail position is diagonally to the head position: distance = 2

These are the three cases we want to cover, and the Euclidean distance squared allows us to check for them easily. We don't have to update the tail position and can just return it again. More difficult is figuring out the position when the tail is too far away.

The head will only move one step at a time meaning we also only have to move the tail one step if we want to catch up. The question is if we need to update the X or Y coordinates or both. You could simply use a bunch of `if` statements like this:

```csharp
var newX = head.X > tail.X ? tail.X + 1 : tail.X - 1;
var newY = head.Y > tail.Y ? tail.Y + 1 : tail.Y - 1;

if (tail.X != head.X && tail.Y == head.Y) return tail with { X = newX };
if (tail.Y != head.Y && tail.X == head.X) return tail with { Y = newY };
return new Vector2(newX, newY);
```

This is what a _programmer_ would do. But what would a _mathematician_ come up with? They will look at this problem and abuse the fact that we are working with two points on a 2-dimensional plane:

```csharp
var delta = Vector2.Subtract(head, tail);
return new Vector2(tail.X + MathF.Sign(delta.X), tail.Y + MathF.Sign(delta.Y));
```

First we use [`Vector2.Subtract`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.vector2.subtract) to calculate the difference between the two positions. This vector will "point" in the direction we need to move the tail position. Here is an example:

```text
tail = (0, 0)
head = (2, 0)
delta = head - tail = (2, 0)
newTail = (1, 0)

tail = (4, 3)
head = (2, 3)
delta = head - tail = (-2, 0)
newTail = (3, 3)

tail = (1, 1)
head = (3, 2)
delta = head - tail = (2, 1)
newTail = (2, 2)
```

The actual values of the difference is not important, the only meaningful thing is whether `X` or `Y` is positive or negative, or in other words, what _sign_ they have.

- In the first example `delta = (2, 0)` the `X` component is positive and the correct new position is `X+1`.
- The second example has a negative `X` and to update the tail position we need use `X-1`.
- In the final example the head moved diagonally and then sideways, both the `X` and `Y` components of the delta is positive, and the tail position has to be updated to `X+1` and `Y+1`.

The [`MathF.Sign`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.MathF.Sign) method will return the following:

- `-1`: the input is negative
- `0`: the input is zero
- `1`: the input is positive

This is exactly what we need. If one of the components is positive we add `1`, if it's negative we subtract `1` and when it's `0` we do nothing. This is the final method:

```csharp
private static Vector2 NewTailPosition(Vector2 tail, Vector2 head)
{
    var distance = Vector2.DistanceSquared(head, tail);
    if (distance <= 2.0f) return tail;

    var delta = Vector2.Subtract(head, tail);
    return new Vector2(tail.X + MathF.Sign(delta.X), tail.Y + MathF.Sign(delta.Y));
}
```

Now we have everything we need and can put it all together:

```csharp
var head = Vector2.Zero;
var tail = Vector2.Zero;

var visitedPositions = motions.SelectMany(motion =>
{
    return Enumerable.Range(0, motion.Steps)
        .Select(_ =>
        {
            head = NewHeadPosition(head, motion.Direction);
            tail = NewTailPosition(tail, head);
            return tail;
        });
}).Distinct().Count();
```

A couple interesting things are going on here. [`Vector2.Zero`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.vector2.zero) is the same as writing `new Vector2(0, 0)`. The puzzle requires us to **count** the number of **unique** positions of the tail. I initially used [`Enumerable.Count`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.count) to count _all_ positions, but that was just me not reading carefully enough. If you want uniqueness you can use [`Enumerable.Distinct`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.distinct).

In order for the head to only do one move at a time, followed by changing the tail position, we need to iterate over the number of steps and not do them all at once. [`Enumerable.Range`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.range) has got us covered, but this will now return an `IEnumerable<Vector2>` which means the outer loop will return an `IEnumerable<IEnumerable<Vector2>>`. This is where [`Enumerable.SelectMany`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.selectmany) comes into play as it can flatten the sequences into one.

## Part Two

{{< details Description >}}
A rope snaps! Suddenly, the river is getting a lot closer than you remember. The bridge is still there, but some of the ropes that broke are now whipping toward you as you fall through the air!

The ropes are moving too quickly to grab; you only have a few seconds to choose how to arch your body to avoid being hit. Fortunately, your simulation can be extended to support longer ropes.

Rather than two knots, you now must simulate a rope consisting of **ten** knots. One knot is still the head of the rope and moves according to the series of motions. Each knot further down the rope follows the knot in front of it using the same rules as before.

Using the same series of motions as the above example, but with the knots marked `H`, `1`, `2`, ..., `9`, the motions now occur as follows:

```text

......
......
.1H3..  (H covers 2, 4)
.5....
6.....  (6 covers 7, 8, 9, s)
```

Now, you need to keep track of the positions the new tail, `9`, visits. In this example, the tail never moves, and so it only visits **`1`** position. However, **be careful**: more types of motion are possible than before, so you might want to visually compare your simulated rope to the one above.

Here's a larger example:

```text
R 5
U 8
L 8
D 3
R 17
D 10
L 25
U 20
```

These motions occur as follows (individual steps are not shown):

Now, the tail (`9`) visits **`36`** positions (including `s`) at least once:

```

Simulate your complete series of motions on a larger rope with ten knots. **How many positions does the tail of the rope visit at least once?**
{{< /details>}}

The description for part two is really, but essentially we are now dealing with **10** points that are **linked** together. This is where your basic data structure course from uni comes back to haunt you because this calls for a linked list. However, different from your student days we don't have to create our own linked list, we can just use the .NET [`LinkedList<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.linkedlist-1):

```csharp
private static int RunPart(IEnumerable<Motion> motions, int knotCount)
{
    var linkedList = new LinkedList<Vector2>(Enumerable.Range(0, knotCount).Select(_ => Vector2.Zero));

    var visitedPositions = motions.SelectMany(motion =>
    {
        return Enumerable.Range(0, motion.Steps)
            .Select(_ =>
            {
                // ...
            });
    }).Distinct().Count();

    return visitedPositions;
}
```

This is almost the same code as before, however instead of having two variables `head` and `tail`, we create a `LinkedList<T>` with `x` amount of zero vectors, and we need to change the code that updates the positions:

```csharp
var headNode = linkedList.First!;
var tailNode = linkedList.Last!;

var newHeadPos = NewHeadPosition(headNode.Value, motion.Direction);
headNode.Value = newHeadPos;

UpdateNodes(headNode.Next!, newHeadPos);
return tailNode.Value;
```

The linked list implementation in .NET can have no elements, in which case `linkedList.First` and `linkedList.Last` will be `null`. Normally you'd want to check for nullability but using `!` at the end we can tell the compiler to trust us and allow this possible `null` value to be used as a non-null value. The .NET `LinkedList<T>` also wraps the values in a [`LinkedListNode<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.linkedlistnode-1), and we can get and set the value via the [`Value`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.linkedlistnode-1.value) property. What's new with this code is the `UpdateNodes` method:

```csharp
private static void UpdateNodes(LinkedListNode<Vector2> node, Vector2 head)
{
    while (true)
    {
        node.Value = NewTailPosition(node.Value, head);
        if (node.Next is null) break;

        var node1 = node;
        node = node.Next;
        head = node1.Value;
    }
}
```

This is where we call `NewTailPosition` on all nodes after the head. We know that we reached the end when there isn't a next node. Just in case you haven't seen this before: `something is null` and `something is not null` is the preferred way of checking if something is null or not. This was added in C# 7 with Pattern matching and should be used instead of `something == null` and `something != null`.

Aside from that, this method is not recursive. The [day before yesterday]({{< ref "/posts/2022-12-01.md" >}}) had a puzzle with recursion so this time I want to fresh things up and show what else you can do. Instead of recursively calling `UpdateNodes` we can use an endless `while` loop and just re-assign `node` and `head` in each iteration until there isn't a next value. Recursion is an easy way of creating stack overflows and should generally be avoided if possible.

With that we are done. Here is the final function that works for any positive number of knots, greater than or equal to 2:

```csharp
private static int RunPart(IEnumerable<Motion> motions, int knotCount)
{
    var linkedList = new LinkedList<Vector2>(Enumerable.Range(0, knotCount).Select(_ => Vector2.Zero));

    var visitedPositions = motions.SelectMany(motion =>
    {
        return Enumerable.Range(0, motion.Steps)
            .Select(_ =>
            {
                var headNode = linkedList.First!;
                var tailNode = linkedList.Last!;

                var newHeadPos = NewHeadPosition(headNode.Value, motion.Direction);
                headNode.Value = newHeadPos;

                UpdateNodes(headNode.Next!, newHeadPos);
                return tailNode.Value;
            });
    }).Distinct().Count();

    return visitedPositions;
}
```

## Conclusion

Another good puzzle. [Yesterday's puzzle]({{<ref "/posts/2022-12-08.md">}}) was also really fun, and I'm hoping the puzzles will keep getting better and more difficult. Today was a great time to relearn some basic mathematics and get reacquainted with linked list.
