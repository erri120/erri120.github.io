## Part One

{{< details Description >}}
The expedition can depart as soon as the final supplies have been unloaded from the ships. Supplies are stored in stacks of marked **crates**, but because the needed supplies are buried under many other crates, the crates need to be rearranged.

The ship has a **giant cargo crane** capable of moving crates between stacks. To ensure none of the crates get crushed or fall over, the crane operator will rearrange them in a series of carefully-planned steps. After the crates are rearranged, the desired crates will be at the top of each stack.

The Elves don't want to interrupt the crane operator during this delicate procedure, but they forgot to ask her **which** crate will end up where, and they want to be ready to unload them as soon as possible so they can embark.

They do, however, have a drawing of the starting stacks of crates **and** the rearrangement procedure (your puzzle input). For example:

```text
    [D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
```

In this example, there are three stacks of crates. Stack 1 contains two crates: crate `Z` is on the bottom, and crate `N` is on top. Stack 2 contains three crates; from bottom to top, they are crates `M`, `C`, and `D`. Finally, stack 3 contains a single crate, `P`.

Then, the rearrangement procedure is given. In each step of the procedure, a quantity of crates is moved from one stack to a different stack. In the first step of the above rearrangement procedure, one crate is moved from stack 2 to stack 1, resulting in this configuration:

```text
[D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3
 ```

In the second step, three crates are moved from stack 1 to stack 3. Crates are moved **one at a time**, so the first crate to be moved (`D`) ends up below the second and third crates:

```text
        [Z]
        [N]
    [C] [D]
    [M] [P]
 1   2   3
 ```

Then, both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1. Again, because crates are moved **one at a time**, crate `C` ends up below crate `M`:

```text
        [Z]
        [N]
[M]     [D]
[C]     [P]
 1   2   3
 ```

Finally, one crate is moved from stack 1 to stack 2:

```text
        [Z]
        [N]
        [D]
[C] [M] [P]
 1   2   3
 ```

The Elves just need to know **which crate will end up on top of each stack**; in this example, the top crates are `C` in stack 1, `M` in stack 2, and `Z` in stack 3, so you should combine these together and give the Elves the message **`CMZ`**.

**After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?**
{{< /details>}}

The hardest part about this puzzle is parsing the input file.

```text
    [D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
```

The file has two regions, 1) the starting state of the stacks and 2) rearrangement procedures. Let's start by reading the file and separating those two regions.

```csharp
var input = await File.ReadAllTextAsync("input.txt", Encoding.UTF8);

var split = input.Split("\n\n", StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);

var stackDefinitions = split[0];
var procedures = split[1];
```

Similar to the [Day 1 puzzle]({{< ref "/posts/2022-12-01.md" >}}) we use [`String.Split`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.split) to separate the input at the empty line. Parsing the stack definitions seems scary, so let's parse the procedures first. Like in the [previous day]({{< ref "/posts/2022-12-04.md" >}}) I decided to use a [`readonly` struct](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct#readonly-struct) that stores the procedures:

```csharp
public readonly struct RearrangementProcedure
{
    public readonly int Count;
    public readonly int From;
    public readonly int To;

    public RearrangementProcedure(int count, int from, int to)
    {
        Count = count;
        From = from;
        To = to;
    }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"move {Count} from {From} to {To}";
    }
}
```

Parsing `move i from a to b` is pretty straight forward, and you can use a multitude of solutions. I decided to use a simple regex pattern to match a line.

```csharp
private static readonly Regex ParseRegex = new(
    @"move (?<count>\d+) from (?<from>\d+) to (?<to>\d+)",
    RegexOptions.Compiled,
    TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500));
```

The Regex implementation in [.NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex) has quite a lot of nuances and options you can tweak to make it go faster. For one, we can use [`RegexOptions.Compiled`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.regularexpressions.regexoptions) to create a [compiled regex](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-options#compiled-regular-expressions). Such a regex is compiled to MSIL code instead of being interpreted, maximizing run-time performance at the expense of some initialization time. This is great since we will be parsing a lot of lines with this. The last parameter of the [Regex Constructor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex.-ctor#system-text-regularexpressions-regex-ctor(system-string-system-text-regularexpressions-regexoptions-system-timespan)) is a [`TimeSpan`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.timespan) that specifies a time-out interval. This isn't required but considered good practice when using regex to prevent a denial of service attack.

```csharp
public static RearrangementProcedure FromString(string line)
{
    var match = ParseRegex.Match(line);
    if (!match.Success) throw new ArgumentException($"Invalid argument: {line}", nameof(line));

    var sCount = match.Groups["count"].Value;
    var sFrom = match.Groups["from"].Value;
    var sTo = match.Groups["to"].Value;

    return new RearrangementProcedure(int.Parse(sCount), int.Parse(sFrom), int.Parse(sTo));
}
```

With our regex in hand, parsing a line is very straight forward. Since the regex includes named groups, we can access them very easily.

Now it's time to deal with the stacks:

```text
    [D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3
```

Before parsing the input, we need to think about how we are going to represent these stacks. Each stack has a unique identifier and a collection of crates. The crates are just single characters, so we can use `char` for those. Since each stack has a unique identifier, a [`Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2) with an `int` as the key type allows for easy access. The question is which collection type should we just for the crates. Thankfully .NET already comes with a built-in [`Stack<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.stack-1) class. Putting this all together our parsing function will have the following signature:

```csharp
private static Dictionary<int, Stack<char>> CreateStacks(string input);
```

The beauty of advent of code is how much freedom you have in dealing with problems. Since you need to produce the correct result **only once**, your code doesn't have to work with every input. We can abuse this fact and create a very simple parser. Let's start by parsing all stack identifiers:

```csharp
var lines = input.Split('\n', StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
var stackIDLine = lines.Last();

var stackIDs = stackIDLine
    .Where(char.IsAsciiDigit)
    .Select(c => int.Parse($"{c}"))
    .ToArray();
```

Since a C# `string` also implements `IEnumerable<char>` we can use LINQ extension methods with it. This code only works if there are less than 10 stacks. My input only had stacks 1 to 9.

```csharp
var stacks = stackIDs.ToDictionary(
    stackID => stackID,
    _ => new Stack<char>(lines.Length - 1));
```

We want a `Dictionary<int, Stack<char>>`, and we have already parsed the identifiers and put them into an array. The extension method [`Enumerable.ToDictionary`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.todictionary#system-linq-enumerable-todictionary-3(system-collections-generic-ienumerable((-0))-system-func((-0-1))-system-func((-0-2)))) creates a dictionary from an enumerable according to specified key and element selector functions. The key is going to be the stack identifier but for the element we want a new `Stack<T>`. The constructor accepts an initial capacity, so I set it to the maximum number of crates.

Now it's time to talk about stacks. They represent a last-in-first-out (LIFO) collection and the essential stack functions are:

- `push`: pushes a new value onto the stack
- `pop`: removes the first value off the stack and returns it
- `peak`: returns the first value without removing it

LIFO means if we add `A`, `B` and `C` the value we get by using `pop` is `C` because it is the last-in and first-out. That being said, let's parse those crates:

```csharp
var enumerable = lines.Take(lines.Length - 1).Reverse();

foreach (var line in enumerable)
{
    var i = 0;

    foreach (var stackID in stackIDs)
    {
        var crate = line[i + 1];
        i += 4;

        if (crate == ' ') continue;
        stacks[stackID].Push(crate);
    }
}
```

LIFO means we have to use [`Enumerable.Reverse`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.reverse) and read the crates from bottom to top. This way the last-in and first-out is the top crate. As for parsing I'm just using a counter `i` for the current position in the line and advance it by `+4` for every stack. Why 4? Because `[A] ` is 4 characters. Once again we can make our lives very easy because the input only has this format. We don't have to make our code work with every possible input, only the one we have.

Now let's recap really quick: we have parsed all rearrangement procedures and stacks. Now we just need to iterate over all procedures and apply them on the stacks:

```csharp
private static void ApplyProceduresOnStacks(
    IReadOnlyDictionary<int, Stack<char>> stacks,
    IEnumerable<RearrangementProcedure> procedures)
{
    foreach (var procedure in procedures)
    {
        var fromStack = stacks[procedure.From];
        var toStack = stacks[procedure.To];
        var count = procedure.Count;

        foreach (var value in fromStack.Take(count))
        {
            fromStack.Pop();
            toStack.Push(value);
        }
    }
}
```

A `Stack<T>` in .NET implements `IEnumerable<T>` meaning we can also fully use LINQ on it. Instead of using a `for-i` loop we can use `foreach` and [`Enumerable.Take`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.take) to take the required number of crates, pop them from the stack and push them onto the other stack.

The last thing we need is putting all of this together and printing out the result:

```csharp
public static async Task Main()
{
    var input = await File.ReadAllTextAsync("input.txt", Encoding.UTF8);
    var split = input.Split("\n\n", StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);

    var stacks = CreateStacks(split[0]);
    var procedures = CreateRearrangementProcedures(split[1]);

    ApplyProceduresOnStacks(stacks, procedures);
    Console.WriteLine($"Part One: {CreateMessage(stacks)}");
}

private static string CreateMessage(IReadOnlyDictionary<int, Stack<char>> stacks)
{
    return stacks
        .Select(kv => kv.Value)
        .Select(stack => stack.First())
        .Aggregate("", (a, b) => $"{a}{b}");
}

```

## Part Two

{{< details Description >}}
As you watch the crane operator expertly rearrange the crates, you notice the process isn't following your prediction.

Some mud was covering the writing on the side of the crane, and you quickly wipe it away. The crane isn't a CrateMover 9000 - it's a **CrateMover 9001**.

The CrateMover 9001 is notable for many new and exciting features: air conditioning, leather seats, an extra cup holder, and the **ability to pick up and move multiple crates at once**.

Again considering the example above, the crates begin in the same configuration:

```text
    [D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3
```

Moving a single crate from stack 2 to stack 1 behaves the same as before:

```text
[D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3
```

However, the action of moving three crates from stack 1 to stack 3 means that those three moved crates **stay in the same order**, resulting in this new configuration:

```text
        [D]
        [N]
    [C] [Z]
    [M] [P]
 1   2   3
```

Next, as both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1, they **retain their order** as well:

```text
        [D]
        [N]
[C]     [Z]
[M]     [P]
 1   2   3
```

Finally, a single crate is still moved from stack 1 to stack 2, but now it's crate `C` that gets moved:

```text
        [D]
        [N]
        [Z]
[M] [C] [P]
 1   2   3
```

In this example, the CrateMover 9001 has put the crates in a totally different order: **`MCD`**.

Before the rearrangement process finishes, update your simulation so that the Elves know where they should stand to be ready to unload the final supplies. **After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?**
{{< /details>}}

The second part is so easy to implement, we literally just have to change two lines:

```csharp
var enumerable = isPartOne ? fromStack.Take(count).ToArray() : fromStack.Take(count).Reverse().ToArray();

foreach (var value in enumerable)
{
    fromStack.Pop();
    toStack.Push(value);
}
```

## Conclusion

The puzzles are starting to become more interesting. Looking at the subreddit and discussions a lot of people have issues with parsing the input this time around which is unsurprising, given how scary it initially looks.
