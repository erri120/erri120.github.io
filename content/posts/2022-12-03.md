## Part One

{{< details Description >}}
One Elf has the important job of loading all of the [rucksacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rucksack) with supplies for the jungle journey. Unfortunately, that Elf didn't quite follow the packing instructions, and so a few items now need to be rearranged.

Each rucksack has two large **compartments**. All items of a given type are meant to go into exactly one of the two compartments. The Elf that did the packing failed to follow this rule for exactly one item type per rucksack.

The Elves have made a list of all of the items currently in each rucksack (your puzzle input), but they need your help finding the errors. Every item type is identified by a single lowercase or uppercase letter (that is, `a` and `A` refer to different types of items).

The list of items for each rucksack is given as characters all on a single line. A given rucksack always has the same number of items in each of its two compartments, so the first half of the characters represent items in the first compartment, while the second half of the characters represent items in the second compartment.

For example, suppose you have the following list of contents from six rucksacks:

```text
vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp
jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL
PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg
wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn
ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT
CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw
```

- The first rucksack contains the items `vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp`, which means its first compartment contains the items `vJrwpWtwJgWr`, while the second compartment contains the items `hcsFMMfFFhFp`. The only item type that appears in both compartments is lowercase **`p`**.
- The second rucksack's compartments contain `jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGL` and `rsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL`. The only item type that appears in both compartments is uppercase **`L`**.
- The third rucksack's compartments contain `PmmdzqPrV` and `vPwwTWBwg`; the only common item type is uppercase **`P`**.
- The fourth rucksack's compartments only share item type **`v`**.
- The fifth rucksack's compartments only share item type **`t`**.
- The sixth rucksack's compartments only share item type **`s`**.

To help prioritize item rearrangement, every item type can be converted to a **priority**:

- Lowercase item types `a` through `z` have priorities `1` through `26`.
- Uppercase item types `A` through `Z` have priorities `27` through `52`.

In the above example, the priority of the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack is 16 (`p`), 38 (`L`), 42 (`P`), 22 (`v`), 20 (`t`), and 19 (`s`); the sum of these is **`157`**.

Find the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack. **What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?**
{{< /details>}}

We went from calories to rock paper scissors and have now arrived at packing a backpack. The task is simple:

- for each line:
    - split the line in half
    - find the _intersection_ between the two halves
    - calculate the priority
- sum up all the priorities

This is honestly not much different from the puzzle of the [first day]({{< ref "/posts/2022-12-01.md" >}}) and I once again reached for the power of LINQ:

```csharp
var lines = await File.ReadAllLinesAsync("input.txt", Encoding.UTF8);

var summedPriorities = lines
    .Select(line =>
    {
        var firstCompartment = line[..(line.Length / 2)].ToHashSet();
        var secondCompartment = line[(line.Length / 2)..].ToHashSet();

        firstCompartment.IntersectWith(secondCompartment);
        return ToPriority(firstCompartment.First());
    }).Sum();

return summedPriorities;
```

We just do the usual projection with [`Enumerable.Select`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.select) but instead of parsing numbers like in the first puzzle, this time we need to work with sets. A set is a collection that contains no duplicate elements, and whose elements are in no particular order. With .NET we have access to [`HashSet<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.hashset-1) which provides high-performance set operations.

Just a quick reminder, set operations come from mathematics. The 3 most common set operations are:

- Union (`A ∪ B`): produces a set of all things that belong to A or B or both
- Intersection (`A ∩ B`): produces a set of all things that belong to A and B
- Differences (`A \ B`): produces a set of all things that belong to A, but not B

In our case we want to find the characters that are in both compartments, so we use [`HashSet<T>.IntersectWith`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.hashset-1.intersectwith) which modifies the current `HashSet<T>` to contain only elements that are present in itself and the specified collection (the other compartment).

Now we only need to convert the character to a priority:

```csharp
private static int ToPriority(char c)
{
    return c switch
    {
        >= 'a' and <= 'z' => c - 96,
        >= 'A' and <= 'Z' => c - 38,
        _ => throw new UnreachableException()
    };
}
```

Once again we are using the amazing C# 8 [Pattern matching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/patterns) and the new [switch expressions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/switch-expression) to calculate the right priority depending on the case of the character. A character can be converted to an integer however we need to offset it by a fixed amount. C# strings are UTF-16 encoded meaning `a` is `95`, `z` is `122`, `A` is `65` and `Z` is `90`. If you don't know how Encoding words, I've got a [great post about it]({{< ref "/posts/2022-04-15.md" >}}).

## Part Two

{{< details Description >}}
As you finish identifying the misplaced items, the Elves come to you with another issue.

For safety, the Elves are divided into groups of three. Every Elf carries a badge that identifies their group. For efficiency, within each group of three Elves, the badge is the **only item type carried by all three Elves**. That is, if a group's badge is item type `B`, then all three Elves will have item type `B` somewhere in their rucksack, and at most two of the Elves will be carrying any other item type.

The problem is that someone forgot to put this year's updated authenticity sticker on the badges. All of the badges need to be pulled out of the rucksacks so the new authenticity stickers can be attached.

Additionally, nobody wrote down which item type corresponds to each group's badges. The only way to tell which item type is the right one is by finding the one item type that is **common between all three Elves** in each group.

Every set of three lines in your list corresponds to a single group, but each group can have a different badge item type. So, in the above example, the first group's rucksacks are the first three lines:

```
vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp
jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL
PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg
```

And the second group's rucksacks are the next three lines:

```
wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn
ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT
CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw
```

In the first group, the only item type that appears in all three rucksacks is lowercase `r`; this must be their badges. In the second group, their badge item type must be `Z`.

Priorities for these items must still be found to organize the sticker attachment efforts: here, they are 18 (`r`) for the first group and 52 (`Z`) for the second group. The sum of these is **`70`**.

Find the item type that corresponds to the badges of each three-Elf group. **What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?**
{{< /details>}}

Part Two requires us to find the intersection of 3 lines at once:

```csharp
private static int PartTwo(IEnumerable<string> lines)
{
    var result = lines
        .Chunk(3)
        .Select(chunk => chunk
            .Select(line => line.ToHashSet())
            .Aggregate((accumulate, next) =>
            {
                accumulate.IntersectWith(next);
                return accumulate;
            })
            .Select(ToPriority)
            .First()
        ).Sum();

    return result;
}
```

Aside from utilizing [`Enumerable.Chunk`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.chunk) to split the lines into chunks of size `3`, there isn't much to explain here. The real hero is the [`Enumerable.Aggregate`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.aggregate) function. With aggregation, you apply an accumulator function over a sequence. Normally you have to specify a starting value of the accumulator but the overload function I used simply uses the first value of the sequence. This accumulator is then modified each iteration using `HashSet<T>.IntersectWith`, and finally we calculate the priority again and sum it all up.

## Conclusion

This puzzle was actually easier than the last one and only tests you on your set knowledge. I can definitely imagine how the second part might create some hideous code if you can't properly chunk the lines with whatever language and libraries you might be using. Converting characters into integers is also a classic move and fits an early puzzle such as this perfectly.
