## Part One

{{< details Description >}}
You avoid the ropes, plunge into the river, and swim to shore.

The Elves yell something about meeting back up with them upriver, but the river is too loud to tell exactly what they're saying. They finish crossing the bridge and disappear from view.

Situations like this must be why the Elves prioritized getting the communication system on your handheld device working. You pull it out of your pack, but the amount of water slowly draining from a big crack in its screen tells you it probably won't be of much immediate use.

**Unless**, that is, you can design a replacement for the device's video system! It seems to be some kind of [cathode-ray tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube) screen and simple CPU that are both driven by a precise **clock circuit**. The clock circuit ticks at a constant rate; each tick is called a **cycle**.

Start by figuring out the signal being sent by the CPU. The CPU has a single register, `X`, which starts with the value `1`. It supports only two instructions:

- `addx V` takes **two cycles** to complete. **After** two cycles, the `X` register is increased by the value `V`. (`V` can be negative.)
- `noop` takes **one cycle** to complete. It has no other effect.

The CPU uses these instructions in a program (your puzzle input) to, somehow, tell the screen what to draw.

Consider the following small program:

```text
noop
addx 3
addx -5
```

Execution of this program proceeds as follows:

- At the start of the first cycle, the `noop` instruction begins execution. During the first cycle, `X` is `1`. After the first cycle, the `noop` instruction finishes execution, doing nothing.
- At the start of the second cycle, the `addx 3` instruction begins execution. During the second cycle, `X` is still `1`.
- During the third cycle, `X` is still `1`. After the third cycle, the `addx 3` instruction finishes execution, setting `X` to `4`.
- At the start of the fourth cycle, the `addx -5` instruction begins execution. During the fourth cycle, `X` is still `4`.
- During the fifth cycle, `X` is still `4`. After the fifth cycle, the `addx -5` instruction finishes execution, setting `X` to `-1`.

Maybe you can learn something by looking at the value of the `X` register throughout execution. For now, consider the **signal strength** (the cycle number multiplied by the value of the `X` register) **during** the 20th cycle and every 40 cycles after that (that is, during the 20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th cycles).

For example, consider this larger program:

```text
addx 15
addx -11
addx 6
addx -3
addx 5
addx -1
addx -8
addx 13

```

The interesting signal strengths can be determined as follows:

- During the 20th cycle, register `X` has the value `21`, so the signal strength is 20 * 21 = **420**. (The 20th cycle occurs in the middle of the second `addx -1`, so the value of register `X` is the starting value, `1`, plus all of the other `addx` values up to that point: 1 + 15 - 11 + 6 - 3 + 5 - 1 - 8 + 13 + 4 = 21.)
- During the 60th cycle, register `X` has the value `19`, so the signal strength is 60 * 19 = **`1140`**.
- During the 100th cycle, register `X` has the value `18`, so the signal strength is 100 * 18 = **`1800`**.
- During the 140th cycle, register `X` has the value `21`, so the signal strength is 140 * 21 = **`2940`**.
- During the 180th cycle, register `X` has the value `16`, so the signal strength is 180 * 16 = **`2880`**.
- During the 220th cycle, register `X` has the value `18`, so the signal strength is 220 * 18 = **`3960`**.

The sum of these signal strengths is **`13140`**.

Find the signal strength during the 20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th cycles. **What is the sum of these six signal strengths?**
{{< /details>}}

Alright, what do we need? We need two instructions: `noop` and `addx`, we need some sort of CPU that keeps track of the cycles and the `X` register and finally there is calculating the signal strength.

Once again, let's start with reading our input and creating the required data types:

```csharp
public class CPU
{
    public Instruction[] Instructions { get; }

    public int X { get; set; } = 1;

    public CPU(Instruction[] instructions)
    {
        Instructions = instructions;
    }
}

public abstract class Instruction
{
    public abstract int CycleCount { get; }
    public abstract void Execute(CPU cpu);
}
```

A simple CPU class that just has an array of instructions and the `X` register. Since we need different types of instructions, we can create an abstract class that the specific instructions will inherit from. The only thing both `noop` and `addx` have is the amount of cycles required and what happens when they execute. One thing I want to note here is that **X starts at 1**. I initially set it to `0` and got weird results because I didn't read the puzzle correctly.

```csharp
public class NoOpInstruction : Instruction
{
    public override int CycleCount => 1;

    public override void Execute(CPU cpu) {}
}
```

The `noop` instruction, of course, doesn't do anything but still takes 1 cycle.

```csharp
public class AddXInstruction : Instruction
{
    private readonly int _value;

    public override int CycleCount => 2;

    public AddXInstruction(int value)
    {
        _value = value;
    }

    public override void Execute(CPU cpu)
    {
        cpu.X += _value;
    }
}
```

The `addx` instruction is similarly uninteresting as it just adds some value to the `X` register and takes 2 cycles. Finally, let's add a parser function to the abstract class:

```csharp
public static Instruction FromString(string line)
{
    if (line == "noop") return new NoOpInstruction();

    var index = line.IndexOf(' ');
    var value = int.Parse(line[(index + 1)..]);
    return new AddXInstruction(value);
}
```

With those data types in place and our instructions parsed, how do we actually run this? The puzzle puts great emphasis on when an instruction actually finishes execution and the result can be observed:

> - At the start of the second cycle, the `addx 3` instruction begins execution. During the second cycle, `X` is still `1`.
> - During the third cycle, `X` is still `1`. After the third cycle, the `addx 3` instruction finishes execution, setting `X` to `4`.
> - At the start of the fourth cycle, the `addx -5` instruction begins execution. During the fourth cycle, `X` is still `4`.

I think this is just an attempt to confuse programmers by using the word [**during**](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zhlfsh/2022_day_10_ohh_so_thats_why_that_word_was/). It threw me off and certainly threw others off. We essentially just have to keep track of the current cycle, the current instruction, when the current instruction started and when it's supposed to "finish". Since the puzzle requires us to do something at specific cycles (20, 60, 100, 140, 180 and 220) we want to _iterate_ over the cycles. If you are thinking of doing a `for-i` loop, I want to show you a great alternative:

```csharp
public class CPU : IEnumerable<int>
{
    public IEnumerator<int> GetEnumerator()
    {
        return new CyclesEnumerator(this);
    }

    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()
    {
        return GetEnumerator();
    }

    private class CyclesEnumerator : IEnumerator<int>
    {
        //...
    }
}
```

We can implement `IEnumerable<T>` freely on any owned class which allows us to use all the LINQ extension methods. The only thing we need is a custom [`IEnumerator<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerator-1). Since we want to iterate over the cycles I choose `int` as the type. Another cool thing is the private nested class `CyclesEnumerator`. It is only visible for the `CPU` class because it is private and nested within it.

```csharp
private readonly CPU _cpu;

private Instruction _currentInstruction;
private int _currentInstructionIndex;
private int _currentInstructionCycleStart;

public int Current { get; private set; }
object IEnumerator.Current => Current;

public CyclesEnumerator(CPU cpu)
{
    _cpu = cpu;
    _currentInstruction = cpu.Instructions[0];
    _currentInstructionIndex = 0;
}

public bool MoveNext()
{
    //...
}

public void Reset()
{
    throw new NotSupportedException();
}

public void Dispose() {}
```

The `IEnumerator<T>` interface requires us to implement the `MoveNext`, `Reset` and `Dispose` methods as well as the `Current` and `IEnumerator.Current` properties. `Dispose` comes from [`IDisposable`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.idisposable) and doesn't require anything special since we don't have to release unmanaged resources. `MoveNext`, `Reset` and `IEnumerator.Current` all come from [`IEnuemrator`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.ienumerator) to enable simple iteration over a non-generic collection. The `Reset` method is not supported since we don't need it.

The important work is done in [`MoveNext`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.ienumerator.movenext) which advances the enumerator to the next element, meaning in our case, to the next cycle. If the method returns `true` it advanced to the next element, if it's `false` we have arrived at the end of the collection.

What does this mean for our `CyclesEnumerator`? We want the following behavior:

- if the current instruction requires more cycles, advance to the next
- if the current instruction does not require more cycles, execute it
- if we have reached the last instruction, stop iteration, otherwise continue with the next instruction

The code would look something like this:

```csharp
public bool MoveNext()
{
    // instruction requires more cycles
    if (_currentInstructionCycleStart + _currentInstruction.CycleCount != Current)
    {
        Current += 1;
        return true;
    }

    // execute the instruction after the specified number of cycles
    _currentInstruction.Execute(_cpu);
    _currentInstructionIndex += 1;

    // no more instructions left
    if (_currentInstructionIndex >= _cpu.Instructions.Length) return false;

    // move to the next instruction
    _currentInstruction = _cpu.Instructions[_currentInstructionIndex];
    _currentInstructionCycleStart = Current;
    Current += 1;

    return true;
}
```

Those are all the ingredients we need for part one. Put all together, and we can calculate the signal strength:

```csharp
var cpu = new CPU(instructions);

var signalStrength = cpu
    .Where(cycle => cycle is >= 20 and <= 220 && (cycle == 20 || (cycle - 20) % 40 == 0))
    .Select(cycle => cycle * cpu.X)
    .Sum();

Console.WriteLine($"Signal Strength is {signalStrength}");
```

## Part Two

{{< details Description >}}
It seems like the `X` register controls the horizontal position of a [sprite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)). Specifically, the sprite is 3 pixels wide, and the `X` register sets the horizontal position of the **middle** of that sprite. (In this system, there is no such thing as "vertical position": if the sprite's horizontal position puts its pixels where the CRT is currently drawing, then those pixels will be drawn.)

You count the pixels on the CRT: 40 wide and 6 high. This CRT screen draws the top row of pixels left-to-right, then the row below that, and so on. The left-most pixel in each row is in position `0`, and the right-most pixel in each row is in position `39`.

Like the CPU, the CRT is tied closely to the clock circuit: the CRT draws **a single pixel during each cycle**. Representing each pixel of the screen as a `#`, here are the cycles during which the first and last pixel in each row are drawn:

```text
Cycle   1 -> ######################################## <- Cycle  40
Cycle  41 -> ######################################## <- Cycle  80
Cycle  81 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 120
Cycle 121 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 160
Cycle 161 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 200
Cycle 201 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 240
```

So, by [carefully](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_the_Beam) [timing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJFnWZH5FXc) the CPU instructions and the CRT drawing operations, you should be able to determine whether the sprite is visible the instant each pixel is drawn. If the sprite is positioned such that one of its three pixels is the pixel currently being drawn, the screen produces a **lit** pixel (`#`); otherwise, the screen leaves the pixel **dark** (`.`).

The first few pixels from the larger example above are drawn as follows:

```text
Sprite position: ###.....................................

Start cycle   1: begin executing addx 15
During cycle  1: CRT draws pixel in position 0
Current CRT row: #

During cycle  2: CRT draws pixel in position 1
Current CRT row: ##
End of cycle  2: finish executing addx 15 (Register X is now 16)
Sprite position: ...............###......................

Start cycle   3: begin executing addx -11
During cycle  3: CRT draws pixel in position 2
Current CRT row: ##.

During cycle  4: CRT draws pixel in position 3
Current CRT row: ##..
End of cycle  4: finish executing addx -11 (Register X is now 5)
Sprite position: ....###.................................

Start cycle   5: begin executing addx 6
During cycle  5: CRT draws pixel in position 4
Current CRT row: ##..#

During cycle  6: CRT draws pixel in position 5
Current CRT row: ##..##
End of cycle  6: finish executing addx 6 (Register X is now 11)
Sprite position: ..........###...........................

Start cycle   7: begin executing addx -3
During cycle  7: CRT draws pixel in position 6
Current CRT row: ##..##.

During cycle  8: CRT draws pixel in position 7
Current CRT row: ##..##..
End of cycle  8: finish executing addx -3 (Register X is now 8)
Sprite position: .......###..............................

Start cycle   9: begin executing addx 5
During cycle  9: CRT draws pixel in position 8
Current CRT row: ##..##..#

During cycle 10: CRT draws pixel in position 9
Current CRT row: ##..##..##
End of cycle 10: finish executing addx 5 (Register X is now 13)
Sprite position: ............###.........................

Start cycle  11: begin executing addx -1
During cycle 11: CRT draws pixel in position 10
Current CRT row: ##..##..##.

During cycle 12: CRT draws pixel in position 11
Current CRT row: ##..##..##..
End of cycle 12: finish executing addx -1 (Register X is now 12)
Sprite position: ...........###..........................

Start cycle  13: begin executing addx -8
During cycle 13: CRT draws pixel in position 12
Current CRT row: ##..##..##..#

During cycle 14: CRT draws pixel in position 13
Current CRT row: ##..##..##..##
End of cycle 14: finish executing addx -8 (Register X is now 4)
Sprite position: ...###..................................

Start cycle  15: begin executing addx 13
During cycle 15: CRT draws pixel in position 14
Current CRT row: ##..##..##..##.

During cycle 16: CRT draws pixel in position 15
Current CRT row: ##..##..##..##..
End of cycle 16: finish executing addx 13 (Register X is now 17)
Sprite position: ................###.....................

Start cycle  17: begin executing addx 4
During cycle 17: CRT draws pixel in position 16
Current CRT row: ##..##..##..##..#

During cycle 18: CRT draws pixel in position 17
Current CRT row: ##..##..##..##..##
End of cycle 18: finish executing addx 4 (Register X is now 21)
Sprite position: ....................###.................

Start cycle  19: begin executing noop
During cycle 19: CRT draws pixel in position 18
Current CRT row: ##..##..##..##..##.
End of cycle 19: finish executing noop

Start cycle  20: begin executing addx -1
During cycle 20: CRT draws pixel in position 19
Current CRT row: ##..##..##..##..##..

During cycle 21: CRT draws pixel in position 20
Current CRT row: ##..##..##..##..##..#
End of cycle 21: finish executing addx -1 (Register X is now 20)
Sprite position: ...................###..................
```

Allowing the program to run to completion causes the CRT to produce the following image:

```text
##..##..##..##..##..##..##..##..##..##..
###...###...###...###...###...###...###.
####....####....####....####....####....
#####.....#####.....#####.....#####.....
######......######......######......####
#######.......#######.......#######.....
```

Render the image given by your program. **What eight capital letters appear on your CRT?**
{{< /details>}}

Part two looks and sounds intimidating but is actually pretty straightforward. We have a grid of pixels that is 40x6 in size. The `X` register is now the position of a "sprite" that is 3 pixels wide. We have to output a `#` when the sprite is visible and a `.` when it's not. The sprite is visible if the current horizontal position is in the sprite:

```csharp
var cpu = new CPU(instructions);

foreach (var cycle in cpu)
{
    var spritePosition = cpu.X;
    var crtPosition = (cycle - 1) % 40;

    if (spritePosition - 1 > crtPosition || spritePosition + 1 < crtPosition)
    {
        // sprite is not visible
        Console.Write('.');
    }
    else
    {
        // sprite is visible
        Console.Write('#');
    }

    if (cycle % 40 == 0) Console.Write('\n');
}
```

The only thing noteworthy are the possibilities of multiple off-by-one errors. **Positions** go from `0` to `39` however **Cycles** go from `1` to `240`:

```text
Cycle   1 -> ######################################## <- Cycle  40
Cycle  41 -> ######################################## <- Cycle  80
Cycle  81 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 120
Cycle 121 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 160
Cycle 161 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 200
Cycle 201 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 240
```

This means cycle `1` is actually at position `0` and the `X` register is interpret as a position meaning the start value of `X=1` will be visible from cycle `1` to `3` or position `0` to `2` (since sprites are 3 pixels wide). It's a bit of a mess but once you got that figured out its easy sailing and the solution looks cool:

## Conclusion

The good puzzles don't stop. [Yesterday]({{<ref "/posts/2022-12-09.md">}}) and the [day before yesterday]({{<ref "/posts/2022-12-08.md">}}) had fun and interesting puzzles, each adding some new concept. Today we were forced to visualize our solution and the puzzle introduces new programmers to some core concepts like CPU instructions and cycles. I also decided to try something different by implement a custom `IEnumerator<T>` which was a good refresher on how that works.
