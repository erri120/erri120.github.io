## Part One

{{< details Description >}}
As you finally start making your way upriver, you realize your pack is much lighter than you remember. Just then, one of the items from your pack goes flying overhead. Monkeys are playing [Keep Away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_away) with your missing things!

To get your stuff back, you need to be able to predict where the monkeys will throw your items. After some careful observation, you realize the monkeys operate based on **how worried you are about each item**.

You take some notes (your puzzle input) on the items each monkey currently has, how worried you are about those items, and how the monkey makes decisions based on your worry level. For example:

```text
Monkey 0:
  Starting items: 79, 98
  Operation: new = old * 19
  Test: divisible by 23
    If true: throw to monkey 2
    If false: throw to monkey 3

Monkey 1:
  Starting items: 54, 65, 75, 74
  Operation: new = old + 6
  Test: divisible by 19
    If true: throw to monkey 2
    If false: throw to monkey 0

Monkey 2:
  Starting items: 79, 60, 97
  Operation: new = old * old
  Test: divisible by 13
    If true: throw to monkey 1
    If false: throw to monkey 3

Monkey 3:
  Starting items: 74
  Operation: new = old + 3
  Test: divisible by 17
    If true: throw to monkey 0
    If false: throw to monkey 1
```

Each monkey has several attributes:

- `Starting items` lists your **worry level** for each item the monkey is currently holding in the order they will be inspected.
- `Operation` shows how your worry level changes as that monkey inspects an item. (An operation like `new = old * 5` means that your worry level after the monkey inspected the item is five times whatever your worry level was before inspection.)
- `Test` shows how the monkey uses your worry level to decide where to throw an item next.
    - `If true` shows what happens with an item if the `Test` was true.
    - `If false` shows what happens with an item if the `Test` was false.

After each monkey inspects an item but before it tests your worry level, your relief that the monkey's inspection didn't damage the item causes your worry level to be **divided by three** and rounded down to the nearest integer.

The monkeys take turns inspecting and throwing items. On a single monkey's **turn**, it inspects and throws all of the items it is holding one at a time and in the order listed. Monkey `0` goes first, then monkey `1`, and so on until each monkey has had one turn. The process of each monkey taking a single turn is called a **round**.

When a monkey throws an item to another monkey, the item goes on the **end** of the recipient monkey's list. A monkey that starts a round with no items could end up inspecting and throwing many items by the time its turn comes around. If a monkey is holding no items at the start of its turn, its turn ends.

In the above example, the first round proceeds as follows:

Monkey 1: 2080, 25, 167, 207, 401, 1046
Monkey 2:
Monkey 3:
```

Monkeys 2 and 3 aren't holding any items at the end of the round; they both inspected items during the round and threw them all before the round ended.

This process continues for a few more rounds:

```text
After round 2, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:
Monkey 0: 695, 10, 71, 135, 350
Monkey 1: 43, 49, 58, 55, 362
Monkey 2:
Monkey 3:

After round 3, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:
Monkey 0: 16, 18, 21, 20, 122
Monkey 1: 1468, 22, 150, 286, 739
Monkey 2:
Monkey 3:

After round 4, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:
Monkey 0: 491, 9, 52, 97, 248, 34
Monkey 1: 39, 45, 43, 258
Monkey 2:
Monkey 3:

After round 5, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:
Monkey 0: 15, 17, 16, 88, 1037
Monkey 1: 20, 110, 205, 524, 72
Monkey 2:
Monkey 3:

After round 6, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:
Monkey 0: 8, 70, 176, 26, 34
Monkey 1: 481, 32, 36, 186, 2190
Monkey 2:
Monkey 3:

After round 7, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:
Monkey 0: 162, 12, 14, 64, 732, 17
Monkey 1: 148, 372, 55, 72
Monkey 2:
Monkey 3:

After round 8, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:
Monkey 0: 51, 126, 20, 26, 136
Monkey 1: 343, 26, 30, 1546, 36
Monkey 2:
Monkey 3:

After round 9, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:
Monkey 0: 116, 10, 12, 517, 14
Monkey 1: 108, 267, 43, 55, 288
Monkey 2:
Monkey 3:

After round 10, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:
Monkey 0: 91, 16, 20, 98
Monkey 1: 481, 245, 22, 26, 1092, 30
Monkey 2:
Monkey 3:

...

After round 15, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:
Monkey 0: 83, 44, 8, 184, 9, 20, 26, 102
Monkey 1: 110, 36
Monkey 2:
Monkey 3:

...

After round 20, the monkeys are holding items with these worry levels:
Monkey 0: 10, 12, 14, 26, 34
Monkey 1: 245, 93, 53, 199, 115
Monkey 2:
Monkey 3:
```

Chasing all of the monkeys at once is impossible; you're going to have to focus on the **two most active** monkeys if you want any hope of getting your stuff back. **Count the total number of times each monkey inspects items** over 20 rounds:

```text
Monkey 0 inspected items 101 times.
Monkey 1 inspected items 95 times.
Monkey 2 inspected items 7 times.
Monkey 3 inspected items 105 times.
```

In this example, the two most active monkeys inspected items `101` and `105` times. The level of **monkey business** in this situation can be found by multiplying these together: **`10605`**.

Figure out which monkeys to chase by counting how many items they inspect over 20 rounds. **What is the level of monkey business after 20 rounds of stuff-slinging simian shenanigans?**
{{< /details>}}

You know the drill by now, let's start with the data and model a monkey:

```text
Monkey 0:
  Starting items: 79, 98
  Operation: new = old * 19
  Test: divisible by 23
    If true: throw to monkey 2
    If false: throw to monkey 3
```

A monkey has an identifier, some starting items, a mathematical operation that produces a new worry level and a test that determines where the monkey will throw the item. There is only one complex thing in the input but let's start by parsing the easy ones first:

```csharp
public static Monkey FromString(string text)
{
    var lines = text.Split('\n', StringSplitOptions.TrimEntries | StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);

    var id = int.Parse(lines[0][7..8]);

    var startingItems = lines[1][16..]
        .Split(',', StringSplitOptions.TrimEntries)
        .Select(long.Parse)
        .ToArray();

    var divisibleBy = int.Parse(lines[3][19..]);
    var monkeyIDIfTrue = int.Parse(lines[4][25..]);
    var monkeyIDIfFalse = int.Parse(lines[5][26..]);

    //...
}
```

Nothing special about this code, we are just getting all lines and doing some very easy parsing. Notice that I'm using hardcoded values for the start position of the substring. This is something you can do in puzzles like these where the form of the input is always the same. I said there is only one complex thing and that is the operation:

```text
Operation: new = old * 19
```

How are we supposed to parse this and later execute? There are a bunch of different approaches but since we are using C#, I want to show you some cool C# features, namely compiling creating an [Expression Tree](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/expression-trees) and compiling a function at runtime.

We want to compile a method that has one parameter `old` and returns the result of either an addition or multiplication (these are the only operations I have in my puzzle input). Once again, you could just hardcode the lambdas:

```csharp
Func<long, long, long> addition = (old, value) => old + value;
Func<long, long, long> multiplication = (old, value) => old * value;
Func<long, long> square = (old) => old * old;
```

However, this is boring. Instead, let's compile a delegate at runtime using expressions:

To build an Expression Tree, we start from within and move outside. The innermost expressions of our delegate are the operands of the binary operation. These are typically called `lhs` for left-hand side and `rhs` for right-hand side. The operands are either some constant value or the parameter `old`. Let's start by creating the parameter first:

```csharp
var parameter = Expression.Parameter(typeof(long), "old");
```

[`Expression.Parameter `](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.expressions.expression.parameter) creates a [`ParameterExpression`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.expressions.parameterexpression) node that represents a named parameter expression, which in our case is of type `long` and has the name `old`. Because both operands can be the parameter or a constant, we can use an inline function and not have to repeat ourselves:

```csharp
Expression ParseOperand(string s)
{
    if (s == "old") return parameter;
    return Expression.Constant(long.Parse(s));
}

var lhs = ParseOperand(operationParts[0]);
var rhs = ParseOperand(operationParts[2]);
```

[`Expression.Constant`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.expressions.expression.constant), of course, creates a [`ConstantExpression`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.expressions.constantexpression) that represents some constant value.

With both operands we can now create the [`BinaryExpression`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.expressions.binaryexpression) for either addition or multiplication:

```csharp
var body = operationParts[1] switch
{
    "+" => Expression.Add(lhs, rhs),
    "*" => Expression.Multiply(lhs, rhs),
    _ => throw new UnreachableException()
};
```

Finally, we put everything together and create and compile our delegate:

```csharp
var expression = Expression.Lambda<Func<long, long>>(body, parameter);
return expression.Compile();
```

The complete method looks like this:

```csharp
private static Func<long, long> ParseOperation(string line)
{
    var rawOperation = line[17..];

    var operationParts = rawOperation.Split(' ', StringSplitOptions.TrimEntries | StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
    var parameter = Expression.Parameter(typeof(long), "old");

    Expression ParseOperand(string s)
    {
        if (s == "old") return parameter;
        return Expression.Constant(long.Parse(s));
    }

    var lhs = ParseOperand(operationParts[0]);
    var rhs = ParseOperand(operationParts[2]);

    var body = operationParts[1] switch
    {
        "+" => Expression.Add(lhs, rhs),
        "*" => Expression.Multiply(lhs, rhs),
        _ => throw new UnreachableException()
    };

    var expression = Expression.Lambda<Func<long, long>>(body, parameter);
    return expression.Compile();
}
```

Now that we can parse the operation it's time to look at the complete `Monkey` class:

```csharp
public class Monkey
{
    public readonly int ID;
    public readonly Queue<long> Items;
    public readonly Func<long, long> Operation;
    public readonly int DivisibleBy;
    public readonly int MonkeyIDIfTrue;
    public readonly int MonkeyIDIfFalse;

    public Monkey(int id, Queue<long> items, Func<long, long> operation, int divisibleBy, int monkeyIDIfTrue, int monkeyIDIfFalse)
    {
        ID = id;
        Items = items;
        DivisibleBy = divisibleBy;
        Operation = operation;
        MonkeyIDIfTrue = monkeyIDIfTrue;
        MonkeyIDIfFalse = monkeyIDIfFalse;
    }

    public static Monkey FromString(string text)
    {
        var lines = text.Split('\n', StringSplitOptions.TrimEntries | StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);

        var id = int.Parse(lines[0][7..8]);

        var startingItems = lines[1][16..]
            .Split(',', StringSplitOptions.TrimEntries)
            .Select(long.Parse)
            .ToArray();

        var items = new Queue<long>(startingItems);

        var divisibleBy = int.Parse(lines[3][19..]);
        var operation = ParseOperation(lines[2]);
        var monkeyIDIfTrue = int.Parse(lines[4][25..]);
        var monkeyIDIfFalse = int.Parse(lines[5][26..]);

        return new Monkey(id, items, operation, divisibleBy, monkeyIDIfTrue, monkeyIDIfFalse);
    }
}
```

One thing of note is the use of [`Queue<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.queue-1). For the [5th day]({{<ref "/posts/2022-12-05.md">}}) we used the last-in-first-out (LIFO) collection [`Stack<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.stack-1), but this puzzle requires a first-in-first-out (FIFO) collection instead.

Having parsed all the monkeys, we can now actually deal with the puzzle. Our goal is to **count** the number of times a monkey inspects an item and **get** the count for the **two** monkeys with the **highest** number of inspected items. Both numbers are then multiplied together to form the _Monkey Business_ value.

[Yesterday]({{<ref "/posts/2022-12-10.md">}}) had us running CPU cycles, this time it's rounds of passing around items. Each round the following happens:

- monkey `0` looks at his items in order
- the worry level of each item gets changed based on the operation
- the worry level gets divided by `3` and rounded down (`3.4` becomes `3`)
- the worry level gets tested by checking if it's divisible by a certain number
- the monkey passes the item to another monkey depending on the outcome of the test
- the next monkey looks at his items in order

Since monkeys have to pass items from one monkey to another by ID, it's best to use a dictionary for key-based access:

```csharp
var monkeys = text
    .Split("\n\n")
    .Select(Monkey.FromString)
    .ToDictionary(monkey => monkey.ID, monkey => monkey);
```

This way we can just do `monkeys[id].Items.Enqueue(something)`. With these types of puzzles its best to start simple and expand later on. Let's start by just looking at one round and how items get moved from one monkey to another:

```csharp
foreach (var (monkeyID, monkey) in monkeys)
{
    while (monkey.Items.TryDequeue(out var worryLevel))
    {
        //...
    }
}
```

The `Queue<T>` class has a neat method `TryDequeue` with returns `true` if the dequeue was successful. This allows for a very simple while loop that dequeues all items in the queue.

```csharp
worryLevel = monkey.Operation(worryLevel);
worryLevel = (long)Math.Floor(worryLevel / 3.0);
```

The worry level is then changed according to the rules: first the operation changes the value, and then we divide by 3 and use [`Math.Floor`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.math.floor) to round down.

```csharp
var test = worryLevel % monkey.DivisibleBy == 0;
if (test)
{
    monkeys[monkey.MonkeyIDIfTrue].Items.Enqueue(worryLevel);
}
else
{
    monkeys[monkey.MonkeyIDIfFalse].Items.Enqueue(worryLevel);
}
```

Finally, we do the test and use the module operator to check if a number is divisible by another one. The item is then moved to the end of the queue of another monkey. Since we need to count the number of times a monkey looks at any item, we can start using LINQ to do that:

```csharp
monkeys
    .OrderBy(pair => pair.Key)
    .Select(pair =>
    {
        var (monkeyID, monkey) = pair;
        var numInspectedItems = monkey.Items.Count;

        while (monkey.Items.TryDequeue(out var worryLevel))
        {
            worryLevel = monkey.Operation(worryLevel);
            worryLevel = (long)Math.Floor(worryLevel / 3.0);

            var test = worryLevel % monkey.DivisibleBy == 0;
            if (test)
            {
                monkeys[monkey.MonkeyIDIfTrue].Items.Enqueue(worryLevel);
            }
            else
            {
                monkeys[monkey.MonkeyIDIfFalse].Items.Enqueue(worryLevel);
            }
        }

        return (monkeyID, numInspectedItems);
    })
```

I use `Enumerable.OrderBy` just to be on the safe side. The dictionary is not ordered and will usually return items in insertion order. We want monkey `0` to be first then monkey `1` and so on.

This code works for one round and returns us the number of inspected items of a monkey that round. The puzzle requires 20 rounds instead of 1 so let's continue using LINQ:

```csharp
var monkeyBusiness = Enumerable
    .Range(0, 20)
    .SelectMany(_ => monkeys
        .OrderBy(pair => pair.Key)
        .Select(pair =>
        {
            //...
        }))
    .GroupBy(pair => pair.monkeyID, pair => pair.numInspectedItems)
    .Select(group => group.Aggregate((a, b) => a + b))
    .OrderDescending()
    .Take(2)
    .Aggregate((a, b) => a * b);

Console.WriteLine($"Monkey Business: {monkeyBusiness}");
```

Using `Enumerable.Range` we can easily do 20 iterations. In each iteration we iterate over every monkey and return the number of inspected items. Since we don't want a list of lists, we use `Enumerable.SelectMany` to flatten `IEnumerable<IEnumerable<(int, int)>>` into `IEnumerable<(int, int)>`. However, we are not done yet because the contents of this sequence contains elements with duplicate IDs (same monkey but different rounds). A simple `Enumerable.GroupBy` will group all those elements by the monkey identifier.

At this point we have a bunch of groups where the key is the monkey identifier and the values are the number of items from each round. This is still not what we want, so let's sum up all the values using aggregation.

What remains is taking the two biggest values and multiplying them together to get the _Monkey Business_ value.

## Part Two

{{< details Description >}}
You're worried you might not ever get your items back. So worried, in fact, that your relief that a monkey's inspection didn't damage an item **no longer causes your worry level to be divided by three**.

Unfortunately, that relief was all that was keeping your worry levels from reaching **ridiculous levels**. You'll need to **find another way to keep your worry levels manageable**.

At this rate, you might be putting up with these monkeys for a **very long time** - possibly **`10000` rounds**!

With these new rules, you can still figure out the monkey business after 10000 rounds. Using the same example above:

After 10000 rounds, the two most active monkeys inspected items 52166 and 52013 times. Multiplying these together, the level of **monkey business** in this situation is now **`2713310158`**.

Worry levels are no longer divided by three after each item is inspected; you'll need to find another way to keep your worry levels manageable. Starting again from the initial state in your puzzle input, **what is the level of monkey business after 10000 rounds?**
{{< /details>}}

Part Two is very interesting. Instead of 20 rounds we now have to run this for **10000** rounds. Not only that, but the worry level does not get divided by 3 anymore. This means that the values will get very big, very fast. The puzzle asks us to find a way to make the worry levels smaller without changing the results of the tests. You _could_ brute force this problem by just using bigger and bigger data types. While this is an option, you can just do a bit of math to find a better solution.

When coming up with a solution it's important to remember that the actual worry level is unimportant. The only important thing is that the test, whether the worry level is divisible by a certain number, has to produce the same output for all monkeys as before. In other words:

For all worry levels `x1 ... xn`, find a function `f(x)` so that `test(xi, yi)` is equal to `test(f(xi), yi)` with `test(x, y)` being `x % y == 0`, for all values of `x` and `y`.

I hope this wording makes it clear that we are dealing with a math puzzle. How do we change the values without changing the outcome?

The solution lies in the fact that we are using a modulo operation for the test, it only has to check if the value is divisible by some other value:

- `7848 mod 12 = 0`: `7848` is divisible by `12`
- `7848 mod 17 = 11`: `7848` is not divisible by `17`

The modulo operation just returns the remainder of `x / y`:

- `7848 / 12`: `7848 = 654 * 12 + 0` ←
- `7848 / 17`: `7848 = 461 * 17 + 11` ←

So let's just make sure for `f(x) / y` the remainders stay the same:

- `7848 mod 17 = 11`
- `11 mod 17 = 1`

Using the remainder of the first operation in the second operation returns the same result. Which makes total sense when you think about it:

- `7848 / 17`: `7848 = 461 * 17 + 11`
- `11 / 17`: `11 = 0 * 17 + 11`

So to reduce the worry level, we just have to use another module operation before the test:

```csharp
worryLevel %= monkey.DivisibleBy;
var test = worryLevel % monkey.DivisibleBy == 0;
```

However, this only works for the current monkey. Every monkey a different test value:

original results:

- `7848 mod 12 = 0`: `7848` is divisible by `12`
- `7848 mod 17 = 11`: `7848` is not divisible by `17`

results with new technique:

- `11 mod 12 = 11`: `11` (previous `7848`) is not divisible by `12`
- `11 mod 17 = 11`: `11` (previous `7848`) is not divisible by `17`

Instead of using `7848 mod 17 mod 17`, how about we use `7848 mod 204 mod 17`:

- `7848 mod 204 = 96`
- `96 mod 12 = 0`
- `96 mod 17 = 11`

This magic value `204` the product of all values of `y`: `p = 12 * 17 = 204`. This is also called a **common multiple** because the result is divisible by all values it was made up of. There is also the **least common multiple** (LCM) but we don't have to use it.

With this new approach we can easily reduce a big number to a smaller one and keeping the test result the same. In order to implement this into the code, we just have to calculate the product before starting the rounds:

```csharp
var product = monkeys.Select(pair => pair.Value.DivisibleBy).Aggregate((a, b) => a * b);
```

Then before doing the test we calculate the new worry level:

```csharp
worryLevel = isPartOne ? (long)Math.Floor(worryLevel / 3.0) : worryLevel % product;
```

The entire final function looks like this:

```csharp
private static void RunPart(string text, bool isPartOne)
{
    var monkeys = text
        .Split("\n\n")
        .Select(Monkey.FromString)
        .ToDictionary(monkey => monkey.ID, monkey => monkey);

    var product = monkeys.Select(pair => pair.Value.DivisibleBy).Aggregate((a, b) => a * b);

    var monkeyBusiness = Enumerable
        .Range(0, isPartOne ? 20 : 10000)
        .SelectMany(_ => monkeys
            .OrderBy(pair => pair.Key)
            .Select(pair =>
            {
                var (monkeyID, monkey) = pair;
                var numInspectedItems = (ulong)monkey.Items.Count;

                while (monkey.Items.TryDequeue(out var worryLevel))
                {
                    worryLevel = monkey.Operation(worryLevel);
                    worryLevel = isPartOne ? (long)Math.Floor(worryLevel / 3.0) : worryLevel % product;

                    var test = worryLevel % monkey.DivisibleBy == 0;
                    if (test)
                    {
                        monkeys[monkey.MonkeyIDIfTrue].Items.Enqueue(worryLevel);
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        monkeys[monkey.MonkeyIDIfFalse].Items.Enqueue(worryLevel);
                    }
                }

                return (monkeyID, numInspectedItems);
            }))
        .GroupBy(pair => pair.monkeyID, pair => pair.numInspectedItems)
        .Select(group => group.Aggregate((a, b) => a + b))
        .OrderDescending()
        .Take(2)
        .Aggregate((a, b) => a * b);

    Console.WriteLine($"Monkey Business: {monkeyBusiness}");
}
```

## Conclusion

The puzzle for the [day before yesterday]({{<ref "/posts/2022-12-09.md">}}) was also math related. I believe the later puzzles will get more intense with the math problems. I honestly struggled quite a lot, trying to explain the solution, and I'm sure there are people who don't understand my incoherent reasoning.
