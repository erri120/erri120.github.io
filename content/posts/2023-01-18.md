## Background

Before I go in-depth on the encryption, I want to start by explaining the background of all of this:

I'm the developer of [GameFinder](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder), a .NET library for finding games installed via various stores. The library supports Steam, GOG Galaxy, the Epic Games Store, Origin and now also EA Desktop. In case you haven't seen the news, [EA is deprecating Origin](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/ea-app) and replacing it with their new program: "EA Desktop" or "EA App". The [old way](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/wiki/Origin) of finding games installed via Origin doesn't work for EA Desktop. This blog post will detail my 4-day journey of figuring out how I can support EA Desktop, which ultimately led to me reverse engineering and breaking its pathetic encryption.

## Start of the journey

All of this began when I wanted to add support for EA Desktop. [Origin](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/wiki/Origin) had previously used manifest files to store information about installed games. These manifest files were located in `C:\Program Data\Origin\LocalContent`, however EA Desktop doesn't create those files anymore.

I started by looking around in `C:\Program Data` and found a folder named `EA Desktop`:

```
C:.
│   machine.ini
│
├───530c11479fe252fc5aabc24935b9776d4900eb3ba58fdc271e0d6229413ad40e
│       CATS
│       IQ
│       IS
│       IS.json
│

│       IQ
│
├───InstallData
│   └───Apex
│       └───base-Origin.SFT.50.0000848
│
└───Logs
        EABackgroundService.log
```

We have some very ominous looking folder names, some installation data and a couple log files. However, notice that `IS.json` file? This is what started this rabbit hole, because it looks like this (you can view the full file [here](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/wiki/EA-Desktop#decrypted-file)):

```json
{
    "installInfos": [
        {
            "baseInstallPath": "",
            "baseSlug": "plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-2",
            "softwareId": "Origin.SFT.50.0000345"
        },
        {
            "baseInstallPath": "E:\\SteamLibrary\\steamapps\\common\\Titanfall2\\",
            "baseSlug": "titanfall-2",
            "softwareId": "Origin.SFT.50.0000532"
        },
        {
            "baseInstallPath": "M:\\Games\\new EA App is shit\\Apex\\",
            "baseSlug": "apex-legends",
            "softwareId": "Origin.SFT.50.0000848"
        },
        {
            "baseInstallPath": "M:\\SteamLibrary\\steamapps\\common\\Need for Speed Heat\\",
            "baseSlug": "need-for-speed-heat",
            "softwareId": "Origin.SFT.50.0001079"
        },
        {
            "baseInstallPath": "",
            "baseSlug": "need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-remastered",
            "softwareId": "Origin.SFT.50.0001232"
        }
    ],
    "schema": {
        "version": 21
    }
}
```

When I found this file, I thought I was done already. This file contains everything I need for the library: the installation path, some identifier and the name of the game. I quickly wrote my implementation and send a debug build of my library to some testers that came back with this error message:

```
Unable to find IS.json inside data folder C:\ProgramData\EA Desktop
```

Turns out I'm the only one that has this `IS.json` file. Looking at the file dates, I noticed that it was created in early December 2022 and never touched again. I'm guessing some earlier version of EA Desktop created this file, but not anymore. Instead, it creates a file called `IS` in the same folder.

## Analysis with CyberChef

**Note:** I will be using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) throughout this blog post, if you want to follow along, you can download my encrypted file from [GitHub](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/blob/6199b82c488760879c570efdd1b2ed7cde28de16/tests/GameFinder.StoreHandlers.EADesktop.Tests/files/IS_erri120.encrypted) and load it into CyberChef.

At this point I had no idea what I'm dealing with, so I grabbed the `IS` file and just looked at the [Hexdump](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=To_Hexdump(16,true,false,false)):

{{< figure align=center src="/img/posts/2023-01-18/EA_Encryption_Hexdump.png" alt="Hexdump of the first 240 bytes" caption="Hexdump of the first 240 bytes" >}}

The file starts out with some kind of 256-bit hash, written as plaintext and the rest is just an incoherent collection of bytes. The [Shannon Entropy](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Drop_bytes(0,64,false)Entropy('Shannon%20scale')) is a good measure to identify if the input is structured or unstructured, and applying it on everything after the hash results in a value of `7.965`:

{{< figure align=center src="/img/posts/2023-01-18/EA_Encryption_Shannon_Entropy.png" alt="Visualization of the Shannon Scale on the input" caption="Visualization of the Shannon Scale on the input" >}}

It's safe to assume the contents are encrypted. Now we only have to figure out what algorithm and key were used.

## Trying out everything

At this point I couldn't do much without doing some reverse engineering. But before I can open up my favorite tool, I had to figure out what process even creates this file. Thankfully the [Sysinternals Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/) are amazing as always and provide the [Process Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) tool for monitoring file activity in real-time.

I noticed that the changed date of the encrypted file changes when I start or stop a download. Realizing this, I prepared a big download of Apex Legends, limited the download speed to 512kb/s and started monitoring with Process Monitor using this filter:

{{< figure align=center src="/img/posts/2023-01-18/ProcessMonitor_Filter.png" alt="Screenshot of Process Monitor that shows a path filter" caption="Adding a path filter to Process Monitor" >}}

With this filter activated, Process Monitor will only display entries where the path points to the encrypted file. After starting the monitoring and resuming and pausing the Apex Legends download a couple of times, I got these results:

{{< figure align=center src="/img/posts/2023-01-18/ProcessMonitor_Results.png" alt="Screenshot of Process Monitor that shows multiply entries that reference the encrypted file" caption="Process Monitor results" >}}

The process `EABackgroundService.exe` seems to be the only one that accesses those files. What's even more impressive with Process Monitor, is the fact that you can double-click any of these entries and view the stack:

{{< figure align=center src="/img/posts/2023-01-18/ProcessMonitor_WriteFile_Stack.png" alt="Screenshot of Process Monitor that shows the stack of the first WriteFile entry" caption="Stack of the first WriteFile entry" >}}

I now had everything I needed: the encrypted file, the decrypted file, the process that creates the file and multiple locations I can investigate.

## Debugging and Reverse Engineering

### Identifying the Algorithm

**Note:** I'm writing this blog post on 2023-01-18, the file version of `EABackgroundService.exe` is `12.85.0.5342` and its SHA256 hash is `ba93d7a3a406128df5adc8f32322a897196eea83a6976b409dbd0e5401a612c8`.

With the stack information from Process Monitor, I could start diving into the assembly code of the process. I used [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/) to attach and debug the process and [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) to reverse engineering compiled code.

I started out by going up the call stack and looking at each function in Ghidra. The first couple functions were just wrapper functions around [`CreateFileW`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilew), [`WriteFile`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile) and other file system related stuff. However, the fourth function at `EABackgroundService+0x271644` was a hit. Not only is this function massive, it references some interesting strings:

- `Saving [{}] into file: \n[{}]`
- `eax::services::localStorage::encryptDataToFile`

I don't think you can get more obvious than this. Turns out that excessive logging with inlined strings are really helpful.

I found an interesting function, now I only had to figure out what it does and where the encryption is being done. For this I don't have any neat tricks up my sleeve, I just put a breakpoint at the start of the function in x64dbg and went through it step by step while also looking at the same code in Ghidra. I was mostly interested in the function parameters being passed, so I kept my eye on the `RCX`, `RDX`, `R8` and `R9` registers which are being used to pass parameters for the [x64 calling convention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-calling-convention?view=msvc-170#parameter-passing).

It didn't take me long to find a very interesting call at `0x270f26` with these parameters:

- `RCX`: address of some region in memory
- `RDX`: address of the plaintext
- `R8`: address to [`01B42F0E7E3B32E7C4251BC38FA2AE2EDB8DC26498E5B73E2A92AC9E8FFCB4F4`](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Hex('Auto')&input=MDEgQjQgMkYgMEUgN0UgM0IgMzIgRTcgQzQgMjUgMUIgQzMgOEYgQTIgQUUgMkUgREIgOEQgQzIgNjQgOTggRTUgQjcgM0UgMkEgOTIgQUMgOUUgOEYgRkMgQjQgRjQ)
- `R9`: address to [`84EFC4B836119C20419398C3F3F2BCEF6FC52F9D86C6E4E8756AEC5A8279E492`](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Hex('Auto')&input=ODQgRUYgQzQgQjggMzYgMTEgOUMgMjAgNDEgOTMgOTggQzMgRjMgRjIgQkMgRUYgNkYgQzUgMkYgOUQgODYgQzYgRTQgRTggNzUgNkEgRUMgNUEgODIgNzkgRTQgOTI)

This was very suspicious. After opening the function in Ghidra, I was very overjoyed to find this:

```c++
// before cleanup
uVar2 = EVP_aes_256_cbc();
iVar1 = FUN_345be0(local_c8, param_2, param_3, param_4, uVar2, local_e8);
if (iVar1 < 1) {
    FUN_54e50(&local_60, "AES256 CBC encryption failed", 0x1c);
}

// after cleanup
cipherType = EVP_aes_256_cbc();
ok = Encrypt(local_c8, plaintext, key, iv, cipherType, encryptedOut);
if (!ok) {
    Log(&local_60, "AES256 CBC encryption failed", 0x1c);
}
```

Turns out that EA Desktop is using [OpenSSL's EVP functions](https://linux.die.net/man/3/evp_cipher_ctx_init) to encrypt their files. In this case the file we need is encrypted using [AES](https://www.nist.gov/publications/advanced-encryption-standard-aes) with a key length of 256 bits using the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode.

Using x64dbg, I just dumped the Key and IV from memory and used [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Drop_bytes(0,64,false)AES_Decrypt(%7B'option':'Hex','string':'01B42F0E7E3B32E7C4251BC38FA2AE2EDB8DC26498E5B73E2A92AC9E8FFCB4F4'%7D,%7B'option':'Hex','string':'84EFC4B836119C20419398C3F3F2BCEF6FC52F9D86C6E4E8756AEC5A8279E492'%7D,'CBC','Raw','Raw',%7B'option':'Hex','string':''%7D,%7B'option':'Hex','string':''%7D)&input=YWxsVXNlcnNHZW5lcmljSWQ) to successfully decrypt the file:

{{< figure align=center src="/img/posts/2023-01-18/EA_Encryption_Decrypted.png" alt="Screenshot of CyberChef that shows the successful decryption" caption="Successful decryption in CyberChef" >}}

### Recreating the IV

At this point I was very happy. I managed to identify the algorithm being used and was able to decrypt the file using the Key and IV from memory. The next step was figuring out how I can recreate them. You have to remember that my goal is to implement a method in my library, that can decrypt the file on its own, without requiring the consumer of the library to do anything special.

I started by following the parameters being passed to the encryption function. These values have to come from somewhere and I intend to find out where. Once again, I'm using x64dbg to step through the function and look closely at the registers. Now that I know what the Key and IV look like, I can identify the functions that create them or at least reference them.

And just as luck would have it, I found a function before the encryption function that accepts some curious parameters and outputs the Key and IV:

- `RCX`: address of some region in memory
- `RDX`: address of the string `allUsersGenericId`
- `R8`: address of the string `IS`

Once again I investigated and after a bit of cleanup, the function essentially does this:

```c++
CreateCryptographicHash(cryptographicHash, 0x100);
AddDataToHash(cryptographicHash, param_2);
AddDataToHash(cryptographicHash, param_3);
ok = FinalizeHash(cryptographicHash, &finalHashOut);
```

These are wrapper functions for [`QCryptographicHash`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcryptographichash.html) from [Qt 5](https://www.qt.io/qt-5-12). `CreateCryptographicHash` is a wrapper for the constructor `QCryptographicHash(QCryptographicHash::Algorithm method)` where they always pass **SHA3 256** as the algorithm and `AddDataToHash` is a wrapper for `addData(const char *data, int length)`.

If you're like me, and you see this, then you quickly head over to [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=SHA3('256')&input=YWxsVXNlcnNHZW5lcmljSWRJUw), input `allUsersGenericIdIS` and create the SHA3 256 hash to get **THE IV** as output: `84efc4b836119c20419398c3f3f2bcef6fc52f9d86c6e4e8756aec5a8279e492`.

**THE IV NEVER CHANGES:** It's always `SHA3_256("allUsersGenericId" + "IS")`, a fucking **constant**.

As a quick side note: remember `530c11479fe252fc5aabc24935b9776d4900eb3ba58fdc271e0d6229413ad40e`? This is the folder name of the file `IS`. This is also a SHA3 256 hash ([CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=SHA3('256')&input=YWxsVXNlcnNHZW5lcmljSWQ)):

```
SHA3_256("allUsersGenericId") = 530c11479fe252fc5aabc24935b9776d4900eb3ba58fdc271e0d6229413ad40e
```

I have no idea where this `allUsersGenericId` comes from, but some genius at EA thought it would be a good idea to include this in almost every hash.

### Recreating the Key

Anyways, we have the IV. Now the remaining part is figuring out how to recreate the Key, which turned out to be more involved than the IV.

The function that creates IV did some more stuff afterwards. They reset the SHA3 256 hash instance and added some very interesting data to it: `allUsersGenericIdISa2a0ad25aa3556c035b34ea63863794e54ad5b53` ([CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=SHA3('256')&input=YWxsVXNlcnNHZW5lcmljSWRJU2EyYTBhZDI1YWEzNTU2YzAzNWIzNGVhNjM4NjM3OTRlNTRhZDViNTM))

```
SHA3_256("allUsersGenericIdISa2a0ad25aa3556c035b34ea63863794e54ad5b53") = 01b42f0e7e3b32e7c4251bc38fa2ae2edb8dc26498e5b73e2a92ac9e8ffcb4f4
```

This is the key we previously dumped from memory. Let's break this down: `"allUsersGenericId" + "IS" + "a2a0ad25aa3556c035b34ea63863794e54ad5b53"`. The first two parts are already known to us, they are the components of the IV. The last part `a2a0ad25aa3556c035b34ea63863794e54ad5b53` is more interesting. This looks like another hash, but it only has a length of 160 bits. Once again we can use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Analyse_hash()&input=YTJhMGFkMjVhYTM1NTZjMDM1YjM0ZWE2Mzg2Mzc5NGU1NGFkNWI1Mw) to analyze this hash:

```
Hash length: 40
Byte length: 20
Bit length:  160

Based on the length, this hash could have been generated by one of the following hashing functions:
SHA-1
SHA-0
FSB-160
HAS-160
HAVAL-160
RIPEMD-160
Tiger-160
```

Based on the previous results, I'm assuming this is a SHA1 hash, since that's the only one that OpenSSL supports. With this information in hand, I decided to try going the opposite way and start with the import of [`EVP_sha1`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/evp_sha1) and look at what references this. Turns out there is only one function that uses this:

```c++
ulonglong HashSomething(undefined8* param_1, undefined8 param_2, int param_3, undefined8* param_4, int param_5) {
    switch (param_5 - 2) {
        //...
        case 3:
            algorithm = EVP_sha1();
            break;
        //...
    }

    ctx = EVP_MD_CTX_new();
    ok = EVP_DigsteInit_ex(ctx, algorithm, nullptr);
    EVP_DigestUpdate(ctx, param_2, param_3);
    EVP_DigestFinal_ex(ctx, *param_4, &param_5);
    EVP_MD_CTX_free(ctx);
}
```

I aptly named this function `HashSomething` as it appears to be some sort of general purpose hashing function that takes some input, the output buffer and probably an enum to control which hashing algorithm should be used. This looked very promising, so I went back to x64dbg, put a breakpoint at the start of the function and inspected the input, only to find this:

```txt
ASRock;                      ;American Megatrends Inc.;To Be Filled By O.E.M.;7CB7433E;PCI\VEN_10DE&DEV_2486&SUBSYS_147A10DE&REV_A1\4&2283F625&0&0019;AuthenticAMD;178BFBFF00A20F10;AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-Core Processor             ;
```

Using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=SHA1(80)&input=QVNSb2NrOyAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgICA7QW1lcmljYW4gTWVnYXRyZW5kcyBJbmMuO1RvIEJlIEZpbGxlZCBCeSBPLkUuTS47N0NCNzQzM0U7UENJXFZFTl8xMERFJkRFVl8yNDg2JlNVQlNZU18xNDdBMTBERSZSRVZfQTFcNCYyMjgzRjYyNSYwJjAwMTk7QXV0aGVudGljQU1EOzE3OEJGQkZGMDBBMjBGMTA7QU1EIFJ5emVuIDcgNTgwMFggOC1Db3JlIFByb2Nlc3NvciAgICAgICAgICAgICA7) to verify my assumption, I was very happy to find out that this is the missing component:

```
SHA1(hardwareInfo) = a2a0ad25aa3556c035b34ea63863794e54ad5b53
```

They hash the hardware info using SHA1, then combine that hash with the constants `allGenericId` and `IS` to create the Key.

### Hardware Information

In order to replicate the hardware info hash, I needed to figure out which components and which properties went into it and where they are getting the information from. On Windows, the best way to do this, is to use the [WMI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/about-wmi). I've never used the WMI, so I just checked out an [example](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/example--getting-wmi-data-from-the-local-computer-asynchronously) to find the library functions I need to look out for. These include `CoInitialize`, `CoCreateInstance` and `CoSetProxyBlanket`, just to name a few. With that newly found information, I went back into Ghidra and went up the call stack of the general purpose hashing function to find something that looks good.

I ended up in a function that was being called by the function that creates the IV and Key. However, I noticed that there was a big fat static initialization being done. Turns out that they collect your hardware information when the process starts and then never again. Using x64dbg to restart the process and I stepped through the static initialization to figure out what was going on.

After a rather tedious process of continuously looking at register values until something made sense, I managed to extract every class and property name used to create the hardware info:

- `Win32_BaseBoard Manufacturer` = `ASRock`
- `Win32_BaseBoard SerialNumber` = ` ` (string with lots of whitespace)
- `Win32_BIOS Manufacturer` = `American Megatrends Inc.`
- `Win32_BIOS SerialNumber` = `To Be Filled By O.E.M.`
- `Win32_VideoController PNPDeviceId` = `PCI\VEN_10DE&DEV_2486&SUBSYS_147A10DE&REV_A1\4&2283F625&0&0019`
- `Win32_Processor Manufacturer` = `AuthenticAMD`
- `Win32_Processor ProcessorId` = `178BFBFF00A20F10`
- `Win32_Processor Name` = `AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-Core Processor` (also had a lot of whitespace at the end)

You can try this out yourself by using the [`wmic`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmic) tool:

```powershell
wmic PATH Win32_BaseBoard get Manufacturer
```

But we're not done yet. There is one value missing: `7CB7433E`. This is the hex value of the serial number of the volume associated with the root directory of your `C:\` drive. It is returned by [`GetVolumeInformationW`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getvolumeinformationw). Note that this a different serial number from the one obtained by `Win32_PhysicalMedia SerialNumber`:

> This function returns the volume serial number that the operating system assigns when a hard disk is formatted. To programmatically obtain the hard disk's serial number that the manufacturer assigns, use the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Win32_PhysicalMedia property SerialNumber.

This flowchart shows the complete process of generating the Key and IV. With those values, you can easily decrypt the file using AES 256 CBC.

Let's go back to the point of all of this: finding out which games are installed. I did all of this just to decrypt a file that contains some installation paths to EA games. I don't understand why this file is encrypted in the first place. It doesn't make any sense. You encrypt a file because it contains sensitive information and/or you want to keep it from prying eyes. Now the question is "who is not supposed to read this file"? The fact that they created the plaintext version of this file at some point but later changed it **on purpose** means they don't want _anyone_ to read it.

And this isn't even all, if you look at the flowchart, you will realize that if the user changes a single hardware component of their PC, the Key will be different, and you won't be able to decrypt the file anymore. The team at EA that implemented this and the person that made the decision to encrypt the file in the first place, have no idea what they are doing. This is a pathetic attempt to prevent users from reading this file.

I have demonstrated how easy it is to "break" the encryption using tools like [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/) and [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra). The "encryption" used by EA Desktop is straight up pathetic and useless. In the off chance that anyone from the team that works on the program is reading this: just write the plaintext file, there is no point in encrypting it.

For me personally, this has been a very fun adventure. I managed to make good progress every day and got more experience using the tools listed above and assembly in general. I can also now finally have support for EA Desktop in my [GameFinder](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder) library, so users can stop pinging me about it.
