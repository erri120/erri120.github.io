## Part One

{{< details Description >}}
You can hear birds chirping and raindrops hitting leaves as the expedition proceeds. Occasionally, you can even hear much louder sounds in the distance; how big do the animals get out here, anyway?

The device the Elves gave you has problems with more than just its communication system. You try to run a system update:

```text
$ system-update --please --pretty-please-with-sugar-on-top
Error: No space left on device
```

Perhaps you can delete some files to make space for the update?

You browse around the filesystem to assess the situation and save the resulting terminal output (your puzzle input). For example:

```text
$ cd /
$ ls
dir a
14848514 b.txt
8504156 c.dat
dir d
$ cd a
$ ls
dir e
29116 f
2557 g
62596 h.lst
$ cd e
$ ls
584 i
$ cd ..
$ cd ..
$ cd d
$ ls
4060174 j
8033020 d.log
5626152 d.ext
7214296 k
```

The filesystem consists of a tree of files (plain data) and directories (which can contain other directories or files). The outermost directory is called `/`. You can navigate around the filesystem, moving into or out of directories and listing the contents of the directory you're currently in.

Within the terminal output, lines that begin with `$` are **commands you executed**, very much like some modern computers:

- `cd` means change directory. This changes which directory is the current directory, but the specific result depends on the argument:
    - `cd x` moves **in** one level: it looks in the current directory for the directory named `x` and makes it the current directory.
    - `cd ..` moves **out** one level: it finds the directory that contains the current directory, then makes that directory the current directory.
    - `cd /` switches the current directory to the outermost directory, `/`.
- `ls` means **list**. It prints out all of the files and directories immediately contained by the current directory:
    - `123 abc` means that the current directory contains a file named `abc` with size `123`.
    - `dir xyz` means that the current directory contains a directory named `xyz`.

Given the commands and output in the example above, you can determine that the filesystem looks visually like this:

```text
- / (dir)
  - a (dir)
    - e (dir)
      - i (file, size=584)
    - f (file, size=29116)
    - g (file, size=2557)
    - h.lst (file, size=62596)
  - b.txt (file, size=14848514)
  - c.dat (file, size=8504156)
  - d (dir)
    - j (file, size=4060174)
    - d.log (file, size=8033020)
    - d.ext (file, size=5626152)
    - k (file, size=7214296)
```

Here, there are four directories: `/` (the outermost directory), `a` and `d` (which are in `/`), and `e` (which is in `a`). These directories also contain files of various sizes.

Since the disk is full, your first step should probably be to find directories that are good candidates for deletion. To do this, you need to determine the **total size** of each directory. The total size of a directory is the sum of the sizes of the files it contains, directly or indirectly. (Directories themselves do not count as having any intrinsic size.)

The total sizes of the directories above can be found as follows:

- The total size of directory `e` is **`584`** because it contains a single file i of size 584 and no other directories.
- The directory a has total size **`94853`** because it contains files `f` (size `29116`), `g` (size `2557`), and `h.lst` (size 62596), plus file i indirectly (`a` contains `e` which contains `i`).
- Directory `d` has total size **`24933642`**.
- As the outermost directory, `/` contains every file. Its total size is **`48381165`**, the sum of the size of every file.

To begin, find all of the directories with a total size of **at most 100000**, then calculate the sum of their total sizes. In the example above, these directories are `a` and `e`; the sum of their total sizes is **`95437`** (`94853` + `584`). (As in this example, this process can count files more than once!)

Find all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000. **What is the sum of the total sizes of those directories?**
{{< /details>}}

Things are finally starting to get interesting. This problem can be solved in numerous ways, but I decided to go with the simplest solution of building out the filesystem structure with classes and iterating over it with recursion. Because the input is just a list of commands of someone navigating the filesystem, using a dictionary with the path as the key and the entry as the value is another way of doing things.

What does a filesystem have? Directories and Files. You could do something really fancy with inheritance, but this is the most straightforward implementation:

```csharp
public sealed class FileSystem
{
    public DirectoryEntry TopDirectory { get; }
    public DirectoryEntry CurrentDirectory { get; private set; }

    public FileSystem()
    {
        TopDirectory = new DirectoryEntry("/", null);
        CurrentDirectory = TopDirectory;
    }
}
```

We will use this `FileSystem` to track the current directory. Directories have a name, subdirectories, files and a parent directory (unless it's the top directory):

```csharp
public sealed class DirectoryEntry
{
    private readonly List<DirectoryEntry> _subDirectories = new();
    private readonly List<FileEntry> _files = new();

    public string Name { get; }
    public DirectoryEntry? Parent { get; }

    public IEnumerable<DirectoryEntry> SubDirectories => _subDirectories;
    public IEnumerable<FileEntry> Files => _files;

    public DirectoryEntry(string name, DirectoryEntry? parent)
    {
        Name = name;
        Parent = parent;
    }

    public void AddSubDirectory(DirectoryEntry directoryEntry)
    {
        _subDirectories.Add(directoryEntry);
    }

    public void AddFile(FileEntry fileEntry)
    {
        _files.Add(fileEntry);
    }
}
```

Files are much simpler, because they only have a name, a parent directory and a file size:

```csharp
public sealed class FileEntry
{
    public string Name { get; }
    public DirectoryEntry Parent { get; }
    public long Size { get; }

    public FileEntry(string name, DirectoryEntry parent, long size)
    {
        Name = name;
        Parent = parent;
        Size = size;
    }
}
```

One thing I want to note here is the use of [`long`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/long-data-type). This signed 64-bit integer can range in value from `-9,223,372,036,854,775,808` through `9,223,372,036,854,775,807`. Assuming that a file size is stored as bytes, the maximum value would be ~9223 Petabytes. This is more than enough for anything this puzzle might throw at us. The .NET class [`FileInfo`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.fileinfo) also uses `long` to represent [file sizes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.fileinfo.length) however other languages such as Rust use [`usize`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.usize.html) which is an unsigned 64-bit integer. C# also has `ulong`, however this type is rarely used because it doesn't have all APIs available that `long` has, mainly because it is not [CLS-compliant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.uint64#remarks).

But enough about integers. We have our data types, now we need to parse the input:

```csharp
private static FileSystem BuildFileSystem(IEnumerable<string> lines)
{
    var fs = new FileSystem();

    foreach (var line in lines)
    {
        if (line.StartsWith('$'))
        {
            var fullCommand = line[2..];
            var executable = fullCommand[..2];

            switch (executable)
            {
                case "cd":
                {
                    var target = fullCommand[3..];
                    break;
                }
                case "ls":
                    break;
                default:
                    throw new UnreachableException("aoc doesn't lie");
            }
        }
    }

    return fs;
}
```

All commands are prefixed with a dollar sign (`$`) followed by a space, then the name of the executable, another space and then the arguments: `$ cd /`. Since there are only two commands (`cd` and `ls`) and both are 2 characters long, we can just hardcode this.

Let's start with `cd` or **c**hange **d**irectory:

```csharp
public DirectoryEntry ChangeDirectory(string to)
{
    switch (to)
    {
        case "/":
            CurrentDirectory = TopDirectory;
            break;
        case "..":
            CurrentDirectory = CurrentDirectory.Parent ?? TopDirectory;
            break;
        default:
        {
            var subDirectory = CurrentDirectory
                .SubDirectories
                .First(dir => dir.Name.Equals(to, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));

            CurrentDirectory = subDirectory;
            break;
        }
    }

    return CurrentDirectory;
}
```

We have 3 possible inputs arguments: `/` will navigate to the top directory, `..` will navigate to the parent directory and anything else to a subdirectory.

```csharp
case "cd":
{
    var target = fullCommand[3..];
    fs.ChangeDirectory(target);
    break;
}
```

The `ls` command is more interesting. In this puzzle, this command is followed by the contents of the current directory. This means the next lines after the command need to be parsed as directory contents, and we have to stop at the next command. A simple running variable keeping track of whether we are parsing directory contents or not is needed:

```csharp
var inLs = false;
foreach (var line in lines)
{
    if (line.StartsWith('$'))
    {
        inLs = false;

        var fullCommand = line[2..];
        var executable = fullCommand[..2];
        switch (executable)
        {
            case "cd":
            {
                var target = fullCommand[3..];
                fs.ChangeDirectory(target);
                break;
            }
            case "ls":
                inLs = true;
                break;
            default:
                throw new UnreachableException("aoc doesn't lie");
        }

        continue;
    }

    if (!inLs) throw new UnreachableException("what is this?");
}
```

As for parsing the output itself, the command will list files and directories. Directories start with a `dir` and files with their file sizes:

```csharp
var split = line.Split(' ', StringSplitOptions.TrimEntries | StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
if (split.Length != 2) throw new UnreachableException("aoc please don't lie");

var firstPart = split[0];
if (firstPart == "dir")
{
    fs.CurrentDirectory.AddSubDirectory(new DirectoryEntry(split[1], fs.CurrentDirectory));
}
else
{
    var fileSize = long.Parse(firstPart);
    fs.CurrentDirectory.AddFile(new FileEntry(split[1], fs.CurrentDirectory, fileSize));
}
```

With this in place, we can parse the input and create a virtual filesystem. But this isn't the goal. The goal is to calculate the sum of all directories with a total size of at most `100000`. To do this we first need a member method to calculate the size of a directory:

```csharp
private long _cachedSize;
public long CalculateSize()
{
    if (_cachedSize != 0) return _cachedSize;

    var subDirectorySizes = _subDirectories
        .Select(subDir => subDir.CalculateSize())
        .Sum();

    _cachedSize = _files.Select(file => file.Size).Sum() + subDirectorySizes;
    return _cachedSize;
}
```

There is a bit of recursion going on here, and I've also opted into using a cache variable because the size won't change. But this isn't the only recursion in my code, we also need to iterate over all directories:

```csharp
public IEnumerable<DirectoryEntry> EnumerateAllDirectories()
{
    foreach (var subDirectory in _subDirectories)
    {
        yield return subDirectory;

        foreach (var directory in subDirectory.EnumerateAllDirectories())
        {
            yield return directory;
        }
    }
}
```

Now we have all the pieces required for the puzzle and solve part one:

```csharp
private static void PartOne(FileSystem fs)
{
    var totalSize = fs.TopDirectory
        .EnumerateAllDirectories()
        .Select(dir => dir.CalculateSize())
        .Where(size => size <= 100000)
        .Sum();

    Console.WriteLine($"Total Size: {totalSize}");
}
```

## Part Two

{{< details Description >}}
Now, you're ready to choose a directory to delete.

The total disk space available to the filesystem is **`70000000`**. To run the update, you need unused space of at least **`30000000`**. You need to find a directory you can delete that will **free up enough space** to run the update.

In the example above, the total size of the outermost directory (and thus the total amount of used space) is `48381165`; this means that the size of the **unused** space must currently be `21618835`, which isn't quite the `30000000` required by the update. Therefore, the update still requires a directory with total size of at least `8381165` to be deleted before it can run.

To achieve this, you have the following options:

- Delete directory `e`, which would increase unused space by `584`.
- Delete directory `a`, which would increase unused space by `94853`.
- Delete directory `d`, which would increase unused space by `24933642`.
- Delete directory `/`, which would increase unused space by `48381165`.

Directories `e` and `a` are both too small; deleting them would not free up enough space. However, directories `d` and `/` are both big enough! Between these, choose the **smallest**: `d`, increasing unused space by **`24933642`**.

Find the smallest directory that, if deleted, would free up enough space on the filesystem to run the update. **What is the total size of that directory?**
{{< /details>}}

There isn't enough space available for the update, and we need to find the smallest directory that would free up enough space for it. Let's start by knowing how much that is:

```csharp
const long maxAvailableSpace = 70000000;
const long requiredAvailableSpace = 30000000;

var totalSize = fs.TopDirectory.CalculateSize();
var currentAvailableSpace = maxAvailableSpace - totalSize;

if (currentAvailableSpace >= requiredAvailableSpace)
    throw new UnreachableException("aoc doesn't lie");

var currentSpaceRequired = requiredAvailableSpace - currentAvailableSpace;
```

The directory we have to find must be bigger and or equal to `currentSpaceRequired`. Thankfully we already have everyything we need and can reuse the previous code:

```csharp
var (dir, size) = fs.TopDirectory
    .EnumerateAllDirectories()
    .Select(dir => (Dir: dir, Size: dir.CalculateSize()))
    .OrderBy(pair => pair.Size)
    .First(pair => pair.Size >= currentSpaceRequired);

Console.WriteLine($"Directory {dir.Name} needs to be deleted to reclaim {size} bytes");
```

## Conclusion

[Yesterday's puzzle]({{<ref "/posts/2022-12-06.md">}}) was way too easy, so I'm happy to see something more involving than window sliding. That being said, this puzzle allows for a lot of different solutions and introduces new programmers to recursion.
