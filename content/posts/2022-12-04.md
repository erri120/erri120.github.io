## Part One

{{< details Description >}}
Space needs to be cleared before the last supplies can be unloaded from the ships, and so several Elves have been assigned the job of cleaning up sections of the camp. Every section has a unique **ID number**, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.

However, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, they've noticed that many of the assignments **overlap**. To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and make a **big list of the section assignments for each pair** (your puzzle input).

For example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:

```text
2-4,6-8
2-3,4-5
5-7,7-9
2-8,3-7
6-6,4-6
2-6,4-8
```

For the first few pairs, this list means:

- Within the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections `2-4` (sections `2`, `3`, and `4`), while the second Elf was assigned sections `6-8` (sections `6`, `7`, `8`).
- The Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections.
- The Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got sections `5`, `6`, and `7`, while the other also got `7`, plus `8` and `9`.

This example list uses single-digit section IDs to make it easier to draw; your actual list might contain larger numbers. Visually, these pairs of section assignments look like this:

```text
.234.....  2-4
.....678.  6-8

.23......  2-3
...45....  4-5

....567..  5-7
......789  7-9

.2345678.  2-8
..34567..  3-7

.....6...  6-6
...456...  4-6

.23456...  2-6
...45678.  4-8
```

Some of the pairs have noticed that one of their assignments **fully contains** the other. For example, `2-8` fully contains `3-7`, and `6-6` is fully contained by `4-6`. In pairs where one assignment fully contains the other, one Elf in the pair would be exclusively cleaning sections their partner will already be cleaning, so these seem like the most in need of reconsideration. In this example, there are **`2`** such pairs.

**In how many assignment pairs does one range fully contain the other?**
{{< /details>}}

It is time for ranges. We get a list of pairs of ranges and need to calculate how many pairs have ranges that fully contain the other. Let's start by parsing the input which looks like this: `1-2,3-4`

```csharp
var commaIndex = line.IndexOf(',');
var firstPart = line[..commaIndex];
var secondPart = line[(commaIndex + 1)..];
```

C# 8 added the [Range operator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/member-access-operators#range-operator-) which we can use on strings to create substrings. This is essentially the same as using [`String.Substring`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.substring). In fact, C# will actually compile `s[index..]` into `s.Substring(...)`. You can observe this behavior on [SharpLab](https://sharplab.io/#v2:CYLg1APgAgTAjAWAFBQMwAJboMLoN7LpGYZRwAM6AsgBRmUDOAlPocewG4CGATugJYA7YAFMAHugC86BgDoAksPEB5AGY0A5ABoNTANxt2RKAHYZAbSGixs2QF0DSdgF9kzoA===). The only thing you need be careful about are off-by-one errors which this puzzle has a lot of.

The code above will split the line `1-2,3-4` into two parts: `1-2` and `3-4`. Next I want to create type to encapsulate these values:

```csharp
public readonly struct AssignmentRange
{
    public readonly int Start;
    public readonly int End;

    public AssignmentRange(int start, int end)
    {
        Start = start;
        End = end;
    }

    public static AssignmentRange FromString(string s)
    {
        var dashIndex = s.IndexOf('-');
        var startIndex = int.Parse(s[..dashIndex]);
        var endIndex = int.Parse(s[(dashIndex + 1)..]);

        return new AssignmentRange(startIndex, endIndex);
    }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"{Start}..{End}";
    }
}
```

This is a [`readonly` struct](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct#readonly-struct) meaning the structure type is immutable, and all data members must have the [`readonly`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/readonly) modifier. We don't have to update these values, so a read-only struct makes sense. I also didn't choose a `class` for this because classes are [reference types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/reference-types) and allocated on the heap. A structure is a [value type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-types) and allocated on the stack. This is ideal for read-only small data types and can often lead to great performance improvements.

The struct also has a function to convert `1-2` into an assignment range. This is basically the same as before, but this time we split at a dash (`-`) instead of a comma (`,`).

Now we have to add code that compares two ranges with each other:

```csharp
public bool ContainsOther(AssignmentRange other)
{
    return Start <= other.Start && End >= other.End;
}
```

This is an instance method of the struct and will check if the other range is contained in the current one. Finally, we put everything together:

```csharp
private static IEnumerable<(AssignmentRange, AssignmentRange)> ToRanges(this IEnumerable<string> lines)
{
    return lines.Select(line =>
    {
        var commaIndex = line.IndexOf(',');
        var firstPart = line[..commaIndex];
        var secondPart = line[(commaIndex + 1)..];

        var first = AssignmentRange.FromString(firstPart);
        var second = AssignmentRange.FromString(secondPart);

        return (first, second);
    });
}

private static int PartOne(IEnumerable<string> lines)
{
    var count = lines.ToRanges()
        .Select(tuple =>
        {
            var (first, second) = tuple;
            return first.ContainsOther(second) || second.ContainsOther(first);
        }).Count(x => x);

    return count;
}
```

The method `ToRanges` is an [`Extension Method`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods) and will just convert the input lines into two assignment ranges. Other than the that the only thing of note is using [`Enumerable.Count`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.count) that returns how many elements in the sequence satisfy our condition.

## Part Two

{{< details Description >}}
It seems like there is still quite a bit of duplicate work planned. Instead, the Elves would like to know the number of pairs that **overlap at all**.

In the above example, the first two pairs (`2-4,6-8` and `2-3,4-5`) don't overlap, while the remaining four pairs (`5-7,7-9`, `2-8,3-7`, `6-6,4-6`, and `2-6,4-8`) do overlap:

- `5-7,7-9` overlaps in a single section, `7`.
- `2-8,3-7` overlaps all of the sections `3` through `7`.
- `6-6,4-6` overlaps in a single section, `6`.
- `2-6,4-8` overlaps in sections `4`, `5`, and `6`.

So, in this example, the number of overlapping assignment pairs is **`4`**.

**In how many assignment pairs do the ranges overlap?**
{{< /details>}}

Instead of knowing if two ranges fully contain the other, we now check if two ranges overlap which is honestly easier:

```csharp
private static bool RangesOverlap(AssignmentRange a, AssignmentRange b)
{
    return a.Start <= b.End && b.Start <= a.End;
}
```
