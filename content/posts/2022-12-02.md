## Part One

{{< details Description >}}
The Elves begin to set up camp on the beach. To decide whose tent gets to be closest to the snack storage, a giant [Rock Paper Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) tournament is already in progress.

Rock Paper Scissors is a game between two players. Each game contains many rounds; in each round, the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand shape. Then, a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper defeats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.

Appreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an **encrypted strategy guide** (your puzzle input) that they say will be sure to help you win. "The first column is what your opponent is going to play: `A` for Rock, `B` for Paper, and `C` for Scissors. The second column--" Suddenly, the Elf is called away to help with someone's tent.

The second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: `X` for Rock, `Y` for Paper, and `Z` for Scissors. Winning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have been carefully chosen.

The winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your **total score** is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the **shape you selected** (`1` for Rock, `2` for Paper, and `3` for Scissors) plus the score for the **outcome of the round** (`0` if you lost, `3` if the round was a draw, and `6` if you won).

Since you can't be sure if the Elf is trying to help you or trick you, you should calculate the score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.

For example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:

```text
A Y
B X
C Z
```

This strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:

- In the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (`A`), and you should choose Paper (`Y`). This ends in a win for you with a score of **`8`** (`2` because you chose Paper + `6` because you won).
- In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (`B`), and you should choose Rock (`X`). This ends in a loss for you with a score of **`1`** (`1` + `0`).
- The third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of `3` + `3` = **`6`**.

In this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of **`15`** (`8` + `1` + `6`).

**What would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?**

It's time for everyone's favorite game "Rock paper scissors"/"Schere, Stein, Papier"/"Pierre-papier-ciseaux"/"Piedra, papel o tijera"/"じゃんけん"/"石头、剪子、布."

Our first objective is using the strategy guide we get from an elf to play in the tournament. The guide contains two columns:

1) what the opponent plays
2) what we should play

For this puzzle we need to calculate the total score if we followed the guide.

Let's start with the basics and define some [Enums](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/enum):

```csharp
public enum RoundOutcome
{
    Lost = 0,
    Draw = 3,
    Won = 6
}

public enum Shape
{
    Rock = 1,
    Paper = 2,
    Scissors = 3
}
```

An enumeration type in C# is just a set of named constants that map to an underlying integer value. Normally the compiler will just auto-generate the value but in our case we want to explicitly specify it. For the `RoundOutcome` I'm using points we get when the round is lost, a draw or won and for `Shape` it's the points we get for playing this shape.

Next we need a function that calculates the round outcome given the opponent input and our input:

```csharp
private static RoundOutcome CalculateRoundOutcome(char opponentInput, char playerInput)
{
    var opponentShape = opponentInput switch
    {
        'A' => Shape.Rock,
        'B' => Shape.Paper,
        'C' => Shape.Scissors,
        _ => throw new UnreachableException()
    };

    var playerShape = playerInput switch
    {
        'X' => Shape.Rock,
        'Y' => Shape.Paper,
        'Z' => Shape.Scissors,
        _ => throw new UnreachableException()
    };

    //...
}
```

Let's start by mapping the raw input we read from the file to our `Shape` enum. Notice the [`UnreachableException`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.unreachableexception) at the end of the switch statement? This is a new exception in .NET 7 that is thrown when the program executes an instruction that was thought to be unreachable. In our case we have pre-defined inputs and anything else _should not_ match.

Next we just need to add the rules of the game:

```csharp
if (opponentShape == playerShape) return RoundOutcome.Draw;

return (opponentShape, playerShape) switch
{
    (Shape.Rock, Shape.Paper) => RoundOutcome.Won,
    (Shape.Rock, Shape.Scissors) => RoundOutcome.Lost,

    (Shape.Paper, Shape.Rock) => RoundOutcome.Lost,
    (Shape.Paper, Shape.Scissors) => RoundOutcome.Won,

    (Shape.Scissors, Shape.Rock) => RoundOutcome.Won,
    (Shape.Scissors, Shape.Paper) => RoundOutcome.Lost,

    _ => throw new UnreachableException()
};
```

These are just the basic rules of the game: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Rock. If the players have the same shape it's a draw. The only cool thing about this code is the utilization of [Pattern matching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/patterns) and the new [switch expressions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/switch-expression) we got in C# 7 and 8.

With the rules in place we just need to calculate the final round score:

```csharp
private static int RoundScore(RoundOutcome outcome, Shape playedShape)
{
    var shapePoints = (int)playedShape;
    return shapePoints + (int)outcome;
}
```

Our enumeration types are just named integers, and we can freely convert between them. The only thing left to do is read the file and get the total score:

```csharp
public static async Task Main()
{
    var totalScore = (await File.ReadAllLinesAsync("input.txt", Encoding.UTF8))
        .Where(line => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(line))
        .Select(line =>
        {
            var opponentInput = line[0];
            var playerInput = line[2];

            var outcome = CalculateRoundOutcome(opponentInput, playerInput);
            return RoundScore(outcome, playerShape);
        })
        .Sum();

    Console.WriteLine($"Total Score: {totalScore}");
}
```

This solution is _okay_. With puzzles like these it's always good to implement a _naive_ solution first in order to understand the problem and figure out the correct value. What I don't like about the code is the massive switch expression where the match the opponent shape and the player shape to figure out the round outcome. So here is a more interesting approach using _math_:

```csharp
var opponentValue = (int)opponentShape;
var playerValue = (int)playerShape;

if (opponentValue == playerValue) return RoundOutcome.Draw;

return opponentValue % 3 + 1 == playerValue
    ? RoundOutcome.Won
    : RoundOutcome.Lost;
```

First we cast the shape enumeration value to an integer (`1` for Rock, `2` for Paper, `3` for Scissors). A draw is the easiest case to check for since it's just the same input, but how do know if someone won or lost with just numbers? Let's write out every situation and look at the results:

```text
1 1 -> draw
2 2 -> draw
3 3 -> draw

1 2 -> won
2 3 -> won
3 1 -> won

1 3 -> lost
2 1 -> lost
3 2 -> lost
```

There is a pattern for the values that win us the game: if the opponent's value offset by `1` and wrapped around to `1` is equal to the player's value, we win.

## Part Two

{{< details Description >}}
The Elf finishes helping with the tent and sneaks back over to you. "Anyway, the second column says how the round needs to end: `X` means you need to lose, `Y` means you need to end the round in a draw, and `Z` means you need to win. Good luck!"

The total score is still calculated in the same way, but now you need to figure out what shape to choose so the round ends as indicated. The example above now goes like this:

- In the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (`A`), and you need the round to end in a draw (`Y`), so you also choose Rock. This gives you a score of `1` + `3` = **`4`**.
- In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (`B`), and you choose Rock so you lose (`X`) with a score of `1` + `0` = **`1`**.
- In the third round, you will defeat your opponent's Scissors with Rock for a score of `1` + `6` = **`7`**.

Now that you're correctly decrypting the ultra top secret strategy guide, you would get a total score of **`12`**.

Following the Elf's instructions for the second column, **what would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?**
{{< /details>}}

In Part Two it turns out we misinterpreted the guide and instead of the second column giving us shape to play, it's the outcome we want. Using our newly gained knowledge from the previous part about numbers, we can easily calculate which shape we need to play to get the desired outcome:

```csharp
private static int PartTwoScore(char opponent, char predictedOutcome)
{
    var opponentShape = OpponentShape(opponent);
    var opponentValue = (int)opponentShape;

    var outcome = predictedOutcome switch
    {
        'X' => RoundOutcome.Lost,
        'Y' => RoundOutcome.Draw,
        'Z' => RoundOutcome.Won,
        _ => throw new UnreachableException()
    };

    var playerValue = outcome switch
    {
        RoundOutcome.Lost => opponentValue == 1 ? 3 : opponentValue - 1,
        RoundOutcome.Won => opponentValue % 3 + 1,
        RoundOutcome.Draw => (int)opponentShape,
        _ => throw new UnreachableException()
    };

    var playerShape = (Shape)playerValue;
    return RoundScore(outcome, playerShape);
}
```

We know the opponent's shape and the round outcome we want. The only thing we need is the player shape which we can get by using the pattern we discovered in part one. The only thing remaining is to update our main function:

```csharp
public static async Task Main()
{
    var scores = (await File.ReadAllLinesAsync("input.txt", Encoding.UTF8))
        .Where(line => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(line))
        .Select(line =>
        {
            var a = line[0];
            var b = line[2];

            var partOne = PartOneScore(a, b);
            var partTwo = PartTwoScore(a, b);

            return (partOne, partTwo);
        })
        .ToArray();

    var partOneTotalScore = scores.Select(x => x.partOne).Sum();
    var partTwoTotalScore = scores.Select(x => x.partTwo).Sum();

    Console.WriteLine($"Part One - Total Score: {partOneTotalScore}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Part Two - Total Score: {partTwoTotalScore}");
}
```

## Conclusion

This puzzle is very interesting. You can go for the speedrun strategy and use pattern matching to quickly solve this puzzle or take more time to think and realize you can just use numbers. The previous puzzles will likely look similar in every implementation but here you can experiment more and come up with some crazy ideas. It will be interesting to see how the [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) implementation will look like.
