## Part One

{{< details Description >}}
The expedition comes across a peculiar patch of tall trees all planted carefully in a grid. The Elves explain that a previous expedition planted these trees as a reforestation effort. Now, they're curious if this would be a good location for a [tree house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_house).

First, determine whether there is enough tree cover here to keep a tree house **hidden**. To do this, you need to count the number of trees that are **visible from outside the grid** when looking directly along a row or column.

The Elves have already launched a [quadcopter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadcopter) to generate a map with the height of each tree (your puzzle input). For example:

```text
30373
25512
65332
33549
35390
```

Each tree is represented as a single digit whose value is its height, where `0` is the shortest and `9` is the tallest.

A tree is **visible** if all of the other trees between it and an edge of the grid are **shorter** than it. Only consider trees in the same row or column; that is, only look up, down, left, or right from any given tree.

All of the trees around the edge of the grid are **visible** - since they are already on the edge, there are no trees to block the view. In this example, that only leaves the **interior nine trees** to consider:

- The top-left `5` is **visible** from the left and top. (It isn't visible from the right or bottom since other trees of height `5` are in the way.)
- The top-middle `5` is **visible** from the top and right.
- The top-right `1` is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to only be trees of height **`0`** between it and an edge.
- The left-middle `5` is **visible**, but only from the right.
- The center `3` is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to be only trees of at most height `2` between it and an edge.
- The right-middle `3` is **visible** from the right.
- In the bottom row, the middle `5` is **visible**, but the `3` and `4` are not.

With 16 trees visible on the edge and another 5 visible in the interior, a total of **`21`** trees are visible in this arrangement.

Consider your map; **how many trees are visible from outside the grid?**
{{< /details>}}

The puzzle input is a simple grid of numbers. Before even thinking about anything else, let's start by converting a bunch of lines into something we can work with:

```csharp
private static int[][] CreateGrid(IEnumerable<string> lines)
{
    return lines
        .Select(line => line
            .Select(c => int.Parse($"{c}"))
            .ToArray())
        .ToArray();
}
```

In C# the type `int[][]` represents a 2D array, meaning an array of arrays. In this case it's an **array of rows**. A common problem when working with multidimensional arrays is forgetting which dimension represents what. We can make our lives simpler by just creating an iterator method:

```csharp
private static IEnumerable<(int, int)> IterateGrid(int[][] grid)
{
    for (var y = 0; y < grid.Length; y++)
    {
        var row = grid[y];
        for (var x = 0; x < row.Length; x++)
        {
            yield return (x, y);
        }
    }
}
```

Using the iterator method results in cleaner code and is more idiomatic when working with LINQ in C#:

```csharp
foreach (var (x, y) in IterateGrid(grid))
{
    //....
}

// or

IterateGrid(grid).Select(tuple =>
{
    var (x, y) = tuple;
    //...
})
```

We have our grid and can iterate over it, great. Now for the hard part. We essentially just need to **count** trees that are visible from outside the grid. We need to count something? That calls for [`Enumerable.Count`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.count#system-linq-enumerable-count-1(system-collections-generic-ienumerable((-0))-system-func((-0-system-boolean)))):

```csharp
var totalVisible = IterateGrid(grid)
    .Count(tuple =>
    {
        var (x, y) = tuple;
        var row = grid[y];
        var value = row[x];

        return false;
    });
```

`Enumerable.Count` will return the number of elements in a sequence that satisfy the predicate function. The puzzle says we need to count the visible trees, let's figure at what makes a tree _visible_. A tree is visible if there are no other trees blocking the view. Meaning from the current tree we look at all trees on the left and right as well as up and down. If the current tree height is greater than all the trees in one direction, it is considered visible.

This calls for more LINQ methods!

```csharp
private static IEnumerable<int> ValuesRight(int[] row, int x)
{
    return row
        // skip to the first value after the current one
        .Skip(x + 1);
}
```

Let's start with the easiest case: all values to the right, or in other terms, all values after the current one. [`Enumerable.Skip`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.skip) skips a specified number of elements in a sequence. Don't forget that `x` is the index into the array meaning we need to add `+1` to skip until the next value.

```csharp
private static IEnumerable<int> ValuesLeft(int[] row, int x)
{
    return row
        // take all values left of the current position in the row
        .TakeWhile((_, x2) => x2 < x)
        // reverse the sequence, so the first element is the first value to the left
        .Reverse();
}
```

All values to the left is also straightforward. Simply get all values with an index less than the current index. The LINQ extension method [`Enumerable.TakeWhile`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.takewhile) has an overload that includes the current index in the predicate. With [`Enumerable.Reverse`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.reverse) we make sure that the first element in the sequence is the first value to the left.

```csharp
private static IEnumerable<int> ValuesDown(int[][] grid, int x, int y)
{
    return grid
        // skip to the first row after the current one
        .Skip(y + 1)
        // select only the values from the same column
        .Select(row2 => row2[x]);
}

private static IEnumerable<int> ValuesUp(int[][] grid, int x, int y)
{
    return grid
        // take all rows above the current one
        .TakeWhile((_, y2) => y2 < y)
        // select only the values from the same column
        .Select(row2 => row2[x])
        // reverse the sequence, so the first element is the first value up
        .Reverse();
}
```

These two methods are essentially the same as `ValuesRight` and `ValuesLeft` but instead of getting values from the current row, we are looking for values in the same column.

With those four methods in place, we just need to call them:

```csharp
var isVisibleFromTheLeft = ValuesLeft(row, x).All(other => other < value);
if (isVisibleFromTheLeft) return true;

var isVisibleFromTheRight = ValuesRight(row, x).All(other => other < value);
if (isVisibleFromTheRight) return true;

var isVisibleFromTheTop = ValuesUp(grid, x, y).All(other => other < value);
if (isVisibleFromTheTop) return true;

var isVisibleFromTheBottom = ValuesDown(grid, x, y).All(other => other < value);
if (isVisibleFromTheBottom) return true;
```

Remember that the goal is to find trees that are visible from any direction. The values in the grid represent the height of the tree and a tree is visible when **all** trees in a direction are smaller. Once again, LINQ has us covered with [`Enumerable.All`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.all) that determines whether all elements of a sequence satisfy a condition.

All put together the solution for part one looks like this:

```csharp
private static void PartOne(int[][] grid)
{
    var totalVisible = IterateGrid(grid)
        .Count(tuple =>
        {
            var (x, y) = tuple;
            var row = grid[y];
            var value = row[x];

            var isVisibleFromTheLeft = ValuesLeft(row, x).All(other => other < value);
            if (isVisibleFromTheLeft) return true;

            var isVisibleFromTheRight = ValuesRight(row, x).All(other => other < value);
            if (isVisibleFromTheRight) return true;

            var isVisibleFromTheTop = ValuesUp(grid, x, y).All(other => other < value);
            if (isVisibleFromTheTop) return true;

            var isVisibleFromTheBottom = ValuesDown(grid, x, y).All(other => other < value);
            if (isVisibleFromTheBottom) return true;

            return false;
        });

    Console.WriteLine($"Total Visible: {totalVisible}");
}
```

## Part Two

{{< details Description >}}
Content with the amount of tree cover available, the Elves just need to know the best spot to build their tree house: they would like to be able to see a lot of **trees**.

To measure the viewing distance from a given tree, look up, down, left, and right from that tree; stop if you reach an edge or at the first tree that is the same height or taller than the tree under consideration. (If a tree is right on the edge, at least one of its viewing distances will be zero.)

The Elves don't care about distant trees taller than those found by the rules above; the proposed tree house has large [eaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaves) to keep it dry, so they wouldn't be able to see higher than the tree house anyway.

In the example above, consider the middle `5` in the second row:

```text
30373
25512
65332
33549
35390
```

- Looking up, its view is not blocked; it can see **`1`** tree (of height `3`).
- Looking left, its view is blocked immediately; it can see only 1 tree (of height `5`, right next to it).
- Looking right, its view is not blocked; it can see **`2`** trees.
- Looking down, its view is blocked eventually; it can see **`2`** trees (one of height `3`, then the tree of height `5` that blocks its view).

A tree's **scenic score** is found by **multiplying together** its viewing distance in each of the four directions. For this tree, this is **`4`** (found by multiplying `1 * 1 * 2 * 2`).

However, you can do even better: consider the tree of height `5` in the middle of the fourth row:

```text
30373
25512
65332
33549
35390
```

- Looking up, its view is blocked at **`2`** trees (by another tree with a height of `5`).
- Looking left, its view is not blocked; it can see **`2`** trees.
- Looking down, its view is also not blocked; it can see **`1`** tree.
- Looking right, its view is blocked at **`2`** trees (by a massive tree of height `9`).

This tree's scenic score is **`8`** (`2 * 2 * 1 * 2`); this is the ideal spot for the tree house.

Consider each tree on your map. **What is the highest scenic score possible for any tree?**
{{< /details>}}

Part two has us checking all trees, calculating some _scenic score_ and finding the **maximum**.

```csharp
var highestScenicScore = IterateGrid(grid)
    .Select(tuple =>
    {
        var (x, y) = tuple;
        var row = grid[y];
        var value = row[x];

        var scenicScore = 0;
        return scenicScore;
    })
    .Max();
```

We can re-use our previous method `IterateGrid` and use [`Enumerable.Max`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.max) to find the highest score. The score is calculated by multiplying the **amount** of visible trees in each direction.

```csharp
var treesVisibleLeft = ValuesLeft(row, x).TakeWhile(left => left < value).Count();
var treesVisibleRight = ValuesRight(row, x).TakeWhile(right => right < value).Count();
var treesVisibleUp = ValuesUp(grid, x, y).TakeWhile(up => up < value).Count();
var treesVisibleDown = ValuesDown(grid, x, y).TakeWhile(down => down < value).Count();

var scenicScore = treesVisibleLeft * treesVisibleRight * treesVisibleUp * treesVisibleDown;
```

The `Values*` methods we created will give us all trees in any direction, so let's just use `Enumerable.TakeWhile` and `Enumerable.Count` to count the number of visible trees. We can't use `Count(left => left < value)` because this would be applied on the entire sequence. We have to count **until** we either find the edge or a tree that is bigger.

The code above will not work as expected. The issue is `Enumerable.TakeWhile`:

```csharp
// Licensed to the .NET Foundation under one or more agreements.
// The .NET Foundation licenses this file to you under the MIT license.
private static IEnumerable<TSource> TakeWhileIterator<TSource>(IEnumerable<TSource> source, Func<TSource, bool> predicate)
{
    foreach (TSource element in source)
    {
        if (!predicate(element))
        {
            break;
        }

        yield return element;
    }
}
```

The puzzle requires that we also include the first taller tree in the count but `Enumerable.TakeWhile` will not return the element where the predicate is not satisfied. Instead, we have to create our own "Take" method:

```csharp
private static IEnumerable<TSource> TakeUntil<TSource>(this IEnumerable<TSource> source, Func<TSource, bool> predicate)
{
    foreach (var element in source)
    {
        yield return element;

        if (!predicate(element))
        {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

Now the code will work as intended:

```csharp
private static void PartTwo(int[][] grid)
{
    var highestScenicScore = IterateGrid(grid)
        .Select(tuple =>
        {
            var (x, y) = tuple;
            var row = grid[y];

            var value = row[x];
            if (value == 0) return 0;

            var treesVisibleLeft = ValuesLeft(row, x).TakeUntil(left => left < value).Count();
            var treesVisibleRight = ValuesRight(row, x).TakeUntil(right => right < value).Count();
            var treesVisibleUp = ValuesUp(grid, x, y).TakeUntil(up => up < value).Count();
            var treesVisibleDown = ValuesDown(grid, x, y).TakeUntil(down => down < value).Count();

            var scenicScore = treesVisibleLeft * treesVisibleRight * treesVisibleUp * treesVisibleDown;
            return scenicScore;
        })
        .Max();

    Console.WriteLine($"Highest Scenic Score: {highestScenicScore}");
}
```

## Conclusion

This puzzle was really fun. By now you should notice that I'm a big fan of LINQ and this puzzle perfectly showcases its power and _style_. Style is really important because you can create the most optimized one liner ever, but nobody will end up understanding what the hell you did. With LINQ you can write fast code that describes itself due to the way extension methods work. Overall I'm very pleased with this puzzle and my solution.
