Image Steganography is nothing new or ground-breaking, it existed since 440 BC [^1] and digital steganography started appearing once personal computers became a thing. This little post is about the methods used by Illusion for their games "Koikatsu!" and "AI Shoujo" and the benefits it provides.

[^1]: The first recorded use can be traced back to 440 BC in Greece, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography#History)

## Character Presets and PNGs

Most games by Illusion are _sandboxy_, they have an active modding community provide an extensive character creation tool that can export your preset. I come from Skyrim where exporting a character preset created with [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080) results in a JSON file full of instructions for the mod but not for the user. If you were to just give the JSON file to someone they won't know how the character looks until they start the game and load the preset. This means you have to include screenshots and the JSON file but that makes Discord preset sharing channels very cluttered.

So what does Illusion do? They just give you a single PNG file:

{{< image src="/img/posts/2021-01-27/Mona.png" alt="Mona Preset" >}}

If you own Koikatsu! then you can just download this image, put it inside your preset folder and it will just work in-game. Of course I immediately opened a my hex editor of choice, [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/), and looked through the data to find what was going on:

{{< image src="/img/posts/2021-01-27/preset-in-hxd.png" alt="Mona Preset in HxD" >}}

It turns out that the data for the preset was appended to the end of the PNG. As you can see in the preview above, this does not affect the render in any way because the parser will just stop at the `IEND` marker. I found out that FFmpeg does not like this extra data at the end and tries to parse another PNG instead of exiting:

## Rewarding Simplicity

You might think "_So what's the deal?_" and that is the point: it is simple to implement and a good solution to the problem of sharing presets, however it is not apparent.

I hope you found this somewhat interesting, if you work on a game that has presets and you don't know how to export them, maybe this has sparked your interest and provided a solution.
