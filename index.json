[{"content":"Day 7 of the Advent of Code. If you have no idea what this is, check my post of the first day.\nDay 7: No Space Left On Device Links: Puzzle Page, My Code\nPart One Description You can hear birds chirping and raindrops hitting leaves as the expedition proceeds. Occasionally, you can even hear much louder sounds in the distance; how big do the animals get out here, anyway?\nThe device the Elves gave you has problems with more than just its communication system. You try to run a system update:\n1 2 $ system-update --please --pretty-please-with-sugar-on-top Error: No space left on device Perhaps you can delete some files to make space for the update?\nYou browse around the filesystem to assess the situation and save the resulting terminal output (your puzzle input). For example:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 $ cd / $ ls dir a 14848514 b.txt 8504156 c.dat dir d $ cd a $ ls dir e 29116 f 2557 g 62596 h.lst $ cd e $ ls 584 i $ cd .. $ cd .. $ cd d $ ls 4060174 j 8033020 d.log 5626152 d.ext 7214296 k The filesystem consists of a tree of files (plain data) and directories (which can contain other directories or files). The outermost directory is called /. You can navigate around the filesystem, moving into or out of directories and listing the contents of the directory you\u0026rsquo;re currently in.\nWithin the terminal output, lines that begin with $ are commands you executed, very much like some modern computers:\ncd means change directory. This changes which directory is the current directory, but the specific result depends on the argument: cd x moves in one level: it looks in the current directory for the directory named x and makes it the current directory. cd .. moves out one level: it finds the directory that contains the current directory, then makes that directory the current directory. cd / switches the current directory to the outermost directory, /. ls means list. It prints out all of the files and directories immediately contained by the current directory: 123 abc means that the current directory contains a file named abc with size 123. dir xyz means that the current directory contains a directory named xyz. Given the commands and output in the example above, you can determine that the filesystem looks visually like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 - / (dir) - a (dir) - e (dir) - i (file, size=584) - f (file, size=29116) - g (file, size=2557) - h.lst (file, size=62596) - b.txt (file, size=14848514) - c.dat (file, size=8504156) - d (dir) - j (file, size=4060174) - d.log (file, size=8033020) - d.ext (file, size=5626152) - k (file, size=7214296) Here, there are four directories: / (the outermost directory), a and d (which are in /), and e (which is in a). These directories also contain files of various sizes.\nSince the disk is full, your first step should probably be to find directories that are good candidates for deletion. To do this, you need to determine the total size of each directory. The total size of a directory is the sum of the sizes of the files it contains, directly or indirectly. (Directories themselves do not count as having any intrinsic size.)\nThe total sizes of the directories above can be found as follows:\nThe total size of directory e is 584 because it contains a single file i of size 584 and no other directories. The directory a has total size 94853 because it contains files f (size 29116), g (size 2557), and h.lst (size 62596), plus file i indirectly (a contains e which contains i). Directory d has total size 24933642. As the outermost directory, / contains every file. Its total size is 48381165, the sum of the size of every file. To begin, find all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000, then calculate the sum of their total sizes. In the example above, these directories are a and e; the sum of their total sizes is 95437 (94853 + 584). (As in this example, this process can count files more than once!)\nFind all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000. What is the sum of the total sizes of those directories?\nThings are finally starting to get interesting. This problem can be solved in numerous ways, but I decided to go with the simplest solution of building out the filesystem structure with classes and iterating over it with recursion. Because the input is just a list of commands of someone navigating the filesystem, using a dictionary with the path as the key and the entry as the value is another way of doing things.\nWhat does a filesystem have? Directories and Files. You could do something really fancy with inheritance, but this is the most straightforward implementation:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 public sealed class FileSystem { public DirectoryEntry TopDirectory { get; } public DirectoryEntry CurrentDirectory { get; private set; } public FileSystem() { TopDirectory = new DirectoryEntry(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, null); CurrentDirectory = TopDirectory; } } We will use this FileSystem to track the current directory. Directories have a name, subdirectories, files and a parent directory (unless it\u0026rsquo;s the top directory):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 public sealed class DirectoryEntry { private readonly List\u0026lt;DirectoryEntry\u0026gt; _subDirectories = new(); private readonly List\u0026lt;FileEntry\u0026gt; _files = new(); public string Name { get; } public DirectoryEntry? Parent { get; } public IEnumerable\u0026lt;DirectoryEntry\u0026gt; SubDirectories =\u0026gt; _subDirectories; public IEnumerable\u0026lt;FileEntry\u0026gt; Files =\u0026gt; _files; public DirectoryEntry(string name, DirectoryEntry? parent) { Name = name; Parent = parent; } public void AddSubDirectory(DirectoryEntry directoryEntry) { _subDirectories.Add(directoryEntry); } public void AddFile(FileEntry fileEntry) { _files.Add(fileEntry); } } Files are much simpler, because they only have a name, a parent directory and a file size:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 public sealed class FileEntry { public string Name { get; } public DirectoryEntry Parent { get; } public long Size { get; } public FileEntry(string name, DirectoryEntry parent, long size) { Name = name; Parent = parent; Size = size; } } One thing I want to note here is the use of long. This signed 64-bit integer can range in value from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 through 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. Assuming that a file size is stored as bytes, the maximum value would be ~9223 Petabytes. This is more than enough for anything this puzzle might throw at us. The .NET class FileInfo also uses long to represent file sizes however other languages such as Rust use usize which is an unsigned 64-bit integer. C# also has ulong, however this type is rarely used because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have all APIs available that long has, mainly because it is not CLS-compliant.\nBut enough about integers. We have our data types, now we need to parse the input:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 private static FileSystem BuildFileSystem(IEnumerable\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; lines) { var fs = new FileSystem(); foreach (var line in lines) { if (line.StartsWith(\u0026#39;$\u0026#39;)) { var fullCommand = line[2..]; var executable = fullCommand[..2]; switch (executable) { case \u0026#34;cd\u0026#34;: { var target = fullCommand[3..]; break; } case \u0026#34;ls\u0026#34;: break; default: throw new UnreachableException(\u0026#34;aoc doesn\u0026#39;t lie\u0026#34;); } } } return fs; } All commands are prefixed with a dollar sign ($) followed by a space, then the name of the executable, another space and then the arguments: $ cd /. Since there are only two commands (cd and ls) and both are 2 characters long, we can just hardcode this.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with cd or change directory:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 public DirectoryEntry ChangeDirectory(string to) { switch (to) { case \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;: CurrentDirectory = TopDirectory; break; case \u0026#34;..\u0026#34;: CurrentDirectory = CurrentDirectory.Parent ?? TopDirectory; break; default: { var subDirectory = CurrentDirectory .SubDirectories .First(dir =\u0026gt; dir.Name.Equals(to, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)); CurrentDirectory = subDirectory; break; } } return CurrentDirectory; } We have 3 possible inputs arguments: / will navigate to the top directory, .. will navigate to the parent directory and anything else to a subdirectory.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 case \u0026#34;cd\u0026#34;: { var target = fullCommand[3..]; fs.ChangeDirectory(target); break; } The ls command is more interesting. In this puzzle, this command is followed by the contents of the current directory. This means the next lines after the command need to be parsed as directory contents, and we have to stop at the next command. A simple running variable keeping track of whether we are parsing directory contents or not is needed:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 var inLs = false; foreach (var line in lines) { if (line.StartsWith(\u0026#39;$\u0026#39;)) { inLs = false; var fullCommand = line[2..]; var executable = fullCommand[..2]; switch (executable) { case \u0026#34;cd\u0026#34;: { var target = fullCommand[3..]; fs.ChangeDirectory(target); break; } case \u0026#34;ls\u0026#34;: inLs = true; break; default: throw new UnreachableException(\u0026#34;aoc doesn\u0026#39;t lie\u0026#34;); } continue; } if (!inLs) throw new UnreachableException(\u0026#34;what is this?\u0026#34;); } As for parsing the output itself, the command will list files and directories. Directories start with a dir and files with their file sizes:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 var split = line.Split(\u0026#39; \u0026#39;, StringSplitOptions.TrimEntries | StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries); if (split.Length != 2) throw new UnreachableException(\u0026#34;aoc please don\u0026#39;t lie\u0026#34;); var firstPart = split[0]; if (firstPart == \u0026#34;dir\u0026#34;) { fs.CurrentDirectory.AddSubDirectory(new DirectoryEntry(split[1], fs.CurrentDirectory)); } else { var fileSize = long.Parse(firstPart); fs.CurrentDirectory.AddFile(new FileEntry(split[1], fs.CurrentDirectory, fileSize)); } With this in place, we can parse the input and create a virtual filesystem. But this isn\u0026rsquo;t the goal. The goal is to calculate the sum of all directories with a total size of at most 100000. To do this we first need a member method to calculate the size of a directory:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 private long _cachedSize; public long CalculateSize() { if (_cachedSize != 0) return _cachedSize; var subDirectorySizes = _subDirectories .Select(subDir =\u0026gt; subDir.CalculateSize()) .Sum(); _cachedSize = _files.Select(file =\u0026gt; file.Size).Sum() + subDirectorySizes; return _cachedSize; } There is a bit of recursion going on here, and I\u0026rsquo;ve also opted into using a cache variable because the size won\u0026rsquo;t change. But this isn\u0026rsquo;t the only recursion in my code, we also need to iterate over all directories:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 public IEnumerable\u0026lt;DirectoryEntry\u0026gt; EnumerateAllDirectories() { foreach (var subDirectory in _subDirectories) { yield return subDirectory; foreach (var directory in subDirectory.EnumerateAllDirectories()) { yield return directory; } } } Now we have all the pieces required for the puzzle and solve part one:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 private static void PartOne(FileSystem fs) { var totalSize = fs.TopDirectory .EnumerateAllDirectories() .Select(dir =\u0026gt; dir.CalculateSize()) .Where(size =\u0026gt; size \u0026lt;= 100000) .Sum(); Console.WriteLine($\u0026#34;Total Size: {totalSize}\u0026#34;); } Part Two Description Now, you\u0026rsquo;re ready to choose a directory to delete.\nThe total disk space available to the filesystem is 70000000. To run the update, you need unused space of at least 30000000. You need to find a directory you can delete that will free up enough space to run the update.\nIn the example above, the total size of the outermost directory (and thus the total amount of used space) is 48381165; this means that the size of the unused space must currently be 21618835, which isn\u0026rsquo;t quite the 30000000 required by the update. Therefore, the update still requires a directory with total size of at least 8381165 to be deleted before it can run.\nTo achieve this, you have the following options:\nDelete directory e, which would increase unused space by 584. Delete directory a, which would increase unused space by 94853. Delete directory d, which would increase unused space by 24933642. Delete directory /, which would increase unused space by 48381165. Directories e and a are both too small; deleting them would not free up enough space. However, directories d and / are both big enough! Between these, choose the smallest: d, increasing unused space by 24933642.\nFind the smallest directory that, if deleted, would free up enough space on the filesystem to run the update. What is the total size of that directory?\nThere isn\u0026rsquo;t enough space available for the update, and we need to find the smallest directory that would free up enough space for it. Let\u0026rsquo;s start by knowing how much that is:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 const long maxAvailableSpace = 70000000; const long requiredAvailableSpace = 30000000; var totalSize = fs.TopDirectory.CalculateSize(); var currentAvailableSpace = maxAvailableSpace - totalSize; if (currentAvailableSpace \u0026gt;= requiredAvailableSpace) throw new UnreachableException(\u0026#34;aoc doesn\u0026#39;t lie\u0026#34;); var currentSpaceRequired = requiredAvailableSpace - currentAvailableSpace; The directory we have to find must be bigger and or equal to currentSpaceRequired. Thankfully we already have everyything we need and can reuse the previous code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 var (dir, size) = fs.TopDirectory .EnumerateAllDirectories() .Select(dir =\u0026gt; (Dir: dir, Size: dir.CalculateSize())) .OrderBy(pair =\u0026gt; pair.Size) .First(pair =\u0026gt; pair.Size \u0026gt;= currentSpaceRequired); Console.WriteLine($\u0026#34;Directory {dir.Name} needs to be deleted to reclaim {size} bytes\u0026#34;); Conclusion Yesterday\u0026rsquo;s puzzle was way too easy, so I\u0026rsquo;m happy to see something more involving than window sliding. That being said, this puzzle allows for a lot of different solutions and introduces new programmers to recursion.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zettdz/2022_day_7_there_it_is_the_most_dangerous_tree_in/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zeuknv/2022_day_7_the_last_3_days_of_challenges/\n","permalink":"https://erri120.github.io/posts/2022-12-07/","summary":"Day 7: No Space Left On Device","title":"Advent of Code 2022: Day 7"},{"content":"Day 6 of the Advent of Code. If you have no idea what this is, check my post of the first day.\nDay 6: Tuning Trouble Links: Puzzle Page, My Code\nPart One Description The preparations are finally complete; you and the Elves leave camp on foot and begin to make your way toward the star fruit grove.\nAs you move through the dense undergrowth, one of the Elves gives you a handheld device. He says that it has many fancy features, but the most important one to set up right now is the communication system.\nHowever, because he\u0026rsquo;s heard you have significant experience dealing with signal-based systems, he convinced the other Elves that it would be okay to give you their one malfunctioning device - surely you\u0026rsquo;ll have no problem fixing it.\nAs if inspired by comedic timing, the device emits a few colorful sparks.\nTo be able to communicate with the Elves, the device needs to lock on to their signal. The signal is a series of seemingly-random characters that the device receives one at a time.\nTo fix the communication system, you need to add a subroutine to the device that detects a start-of-packet marker in the datastream. In the protocol being used by the Elves, the start of a packet is indicated by a sequence of four characters that are all different.\nThe device will send your subroutine a datastream buffer (your puzzle input); your subroutine needs to identify the first position where the four most recently received characters were all different. Specifically, it needs to report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the first such four-character marker.\nFor example, suppose you receive the following datastream buffer:\n1 mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb After the first three characters (mjq) have been received, there haven\u0026rsquo;t been enough characters received yet to find the marker. The first time a marker could occur is after the fourth character is received, making the most recent four characters mjqj. Because j is repeated, this isn\u0026rsquo;t a marker.\nThe first time a marker appears is after the seventh character arrives. Once it does, the last four characters received are jpqm, which are all different. In this case, your subroutine should report the value 7, because the first start-of-packet marker is complete after 7 characters have been processed.\nHere are a few more examples:\nbvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz: first marker after character 5 nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg: first marker after character 6 nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg: first marker after character 10 zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw: first marker after character 11 How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet marker is detected?\nThis puzzle is very easy and straightforward. We just need to look for a group of 4 unique characters in a string:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 private static void PartOne(string contents) { for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; contents.Length; i++) { if (i + 4 \u0026gt; contents.Length) continue; var range = new Range(i, i + 4); var group = contents[range]; var onlyUnique = group.Distinct().Count() == 4; if (!onlyUnique) continue; Console.WriteLine($\u0026#34;start-of-packet marker: \u0026#39;{group}\u0026#39; ({range})\u0026#34;); } throw new UnreachableException(); } With Range we can easily do a substring on the input and using LINQ Enumerable.Distinct + Enumerable.Count it is trivial to count the number of unique characters.\nPart Two Description Your device\u0026rsquo;s communication system is correctly detecting packets, but still isn\u0026rsquo;t working. It looks like it also needs to look for messages.\nA start-of-message marker is just like a start-of-packet marker, except it consists of 14 distinct characters rather than 4.\nHere are the first positions of start-of-message markers for all of the above examples:\nmjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb: first marker after character 19 bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz: first marker after character 23 nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg: first marker after character 23 nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg: first marker after character 29 zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw: first marker after character 26 How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-message marker is detected?\nPart two is essentially the same thing as part one, expect we are now looking for a substring of unique characters with length 14. We can just refactor the previous solution into a more general purpose method:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 private static Range FindMarker(string contents, int markerLength) { for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; contents.Length; i++) { if (i + markerLength \u0026gt; contents.Length) continue; var range = new Range(i, i + markerLength); var group = contents[range]; var onlyUnique = group.Distinct().Count() == markerLength; if (onlyUnique) return range; } throw new UnreachableException(); } This makes it trivial to find markers of any length.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 public static async Task Main() { var contents = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(\u0026#34;input.txt\u0026#34;, Encoding.UTF8); var partOne = FindMarker(contents, 4); var partTwo = FindMarker(contents, 14); Console.WriteLine($\u0026#34;start-of-packet marker: \u0026#39;{contents[partOne]}\u0026#39; ({partOne})\u0026#34;); Console.WriteLine($\u0026#34;start-of-message marker: \u0026#39;{contents[partTwo]}\u0026#39; ({partTwo})\u0026#34;); } Conclusion This has been the second-easiest puzzle so far. The only one easier than this was the first puzzle.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/ze1gkc/20152022_any_day_incompetence/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/ze65ji/2022_day_6_it_cant_be_that_easy/\n","permalink":"https://erri120.github.io/posts/2022-12-06/","summary":"Day 6: Supply Stacks","title":"Advent of Code 2022: Day 6"},{"content":"Day 5 of the Advent of Code. If you have no idea what this is, check my post of the first day.\nDay 5: Supply Stacks Links: Puzzle Page, My Code\nPart One Description The expedition can depart as soon as the final supplies have been unloaded from the ships. Supplies are stored in stacks of marked crates, but because the needed supplies are buried under many other crates, the crates need to be rearranged.\nThe ship has a giant cargo crane capable of moving crates between stacks. To ensure none of the crates get crushed or fall over, the crane operator will rearrange them in a series of carefully-planned steps. After the crates are rearranged, the desired crates will be at the top of each stack.\nThe Elves don\u0026rsquo;t want to interrupt the crane operator during this delicate procedure, but they forgot to ask her which crate will end up where, and they want to be ready to unload them as soon as possible so they can embark.\nThey do, however, have a drawing of the starting stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure (your puzzle input). For example:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 [D] [N] [C] [Z] [M] [P] 1 2 3 move 1 from 2 to 1 move 3 from 1 to 3 move 2 from 2 to 1 move 1 from 1 to 2 In this example, there are three stacks of crates. Stack 1 contains two crates: crate Z is on the bottom, and crate N is on top. Stack 2 contains three crates; from bottom to top, they are crates M, C, and D. Finally, stack 3 contains a single crate, P.\nThen, the rearrangement procedure is given. In each step of the procedure, a quantity of crates is moved from one stack to a different stack. In the first step of the above rearrangement procedure, one crate is moved from stack 2 to stack 1, resulting in this configuration:\n1 2 3 4 [D] [N] [C] [Z] [M] [P] 1 2 3 In the second step, three crates are moved from stack 1 to stack 3. Crates are moved one at a time, so the first crate to be moved (D) ends up below the second and third crates:\n1 2 3 4 5 [Z] [N] [C] [D] [M] [P] 1 2 3 Then, both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1. Again, because crates are moved one at a time, crate C ends up below crate M:\n1 2 3 4 5 [Z] [N] [M] [D] [C] [P] 1 2 3 Finally, one crate is moved from stack 1 to stack 2:\n1 2 3 4 5 [Z] [N] [D] [C] [M] [P] 1 2 3 The Elves just need to know which crate will end up on top of each stack; in this example, the top crates are C in stack 1, M in stack 2, and Z in stack 3, so you should combine these together and give the Elves the message CMZ.\nAfter the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?\nThe hardest part about this puzzle is parsing the input file.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 [D] [N] [C] [Z] [M] [P] 1 2 3 move 1 from 2 to 1 move 3 from 1 to 3 move 2 from 2 to 1 move 1 from 1 to 2 The file has two regions, 1) the starting state of the stacks and 2) rearrangement procedures. Let\u0026rsquo;s start by reading the file and separating those two regions.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 var input = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(\u0026#34;input.txt\u0026#34;, Encoding.UTF8); var split = input.Split(\u0026#34;\\n\\n\u0026#34;, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries); var stackDefinitions = split[0]; var procedures = split[1]; Similar to the Day 1 puzzle we use String.Split to separate the input at the empty line. Parsing the stack definitions seems scary, so let\u0026rsquo;s parse the procedures first. Like in the previous day I decided to use a readonly struct that stores the procedures:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 public readonly struct RearrangementProcedure { public readonly int Count; public readonly int From; public readonly int To; public RearrangementProcedure(int count, int from, int to) { Count = count; From = from; To = to; } public override string ToString() { return $\u0026#34;move {Count} from {From} to {To}\u0026#34;; } } Parsing move i from a to b is pretty straight forward, and you can use a multitude of solutions. I decided to use a simple regex pattern to match a line.\n1 2 3 4 private static readonly Regex ParseRegex = new( @\u0026#34;move (?\u0026lt;count\u0026gt;\\d+) from (?\u0026lt;from\u0026gt;\\d+) to (?\u0026lt;to\u0026gt;\\d+)\u0026#34;, RegexOptions.Compiled, TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500)); The Regex implementation in .NET has quite a lot of nuances and options you can tweak to make it go faster. For one, we can use RegexOptions.Compiled to create a compiled regex. Such a regex is compiled to MSIL code instead of being interpreted, maximizing run-time performance at the expense of some initialization time. This is great since we will be parsing a lot of lines with this. The last parameter of the Regex Constructor is a TimeSpan that specifies a time-out interval. This isn\u0026rsquo;t required but considered good practice when using regex to prevent a denial of service attack.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 public static RearrangementProcedure FromString(string line) { var match = ParseRegex.Match(line); if (!match.Success) throw new ArgumentException($\u0026#34;Invalid argument: {line}\u0026#34;, nameof(line)); var sCount = match.Groups[\u0026#34;count\u0026#34;].Value; var sFrom = match.Groups[\u0026#34;from\u0026#34;].Value; var sTo = match.Groups[\u0026#34;to\u0026#34;].Value; return new RearrangementProcedure(int.Parse(sCount), int.Parse(sFrom), int.Parse(sTo)); } With our regex in hand, parsing a line is very straight forward. Since the regex includes named groups, we can access them very easily.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time to deal with the stacks:\n1 2 3 4 [D] [N] [C] [Z] [M] [P] 1 2 3 Before parsing the input, we need to think about how we are going to represent these stacks. Each stack has a unique identifier and a collection of crates. The crates are just single characters, so we can use char for those. Since each stack has a unique identifier, a Dictionary\u0026lt;TKey, TValue\u0026gt; with an int as the key type allows for easy access. The question is which collection type should we just for the crates. Thankfully .NET already comes with a built-in Stack\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; class. Putting this all together our parsing function will have the following signature:\n1 private static Dictionary\u0026lt;int, Stack\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;\u0026gt; CreateStacks(string input); The beauty of advent of code is how much freedom you have in dealing with problems. Since you need to produce the correct result only once, your code doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to work with every input. We can abuse this fact and create a very simple parser. Let\u0026rsquo;s start by parsing all stack identifiers:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 var lines = input.Split(\u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries); var stackIDLine = lines.Last(); var stackIDs = stackIDLine .Where(char.IsAsciiDigit) .Select(c =\u0026gt; int.Parse($\u0026#34;{c}\u0026#34;)) .ToArray(); Since a C# string also implements IEnumerable\u0026lt;char\u0026gt; we can use LINQ extension methods with it. This code only works if there are less than 10 stacks. My input only had stacks 1 to 9.\n1 2 3 var stacks = stackIDs.ToDictionary( stackID =\u0026gt; stackID, _ =\u0026gt; new Stack\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;(lines.Length - 1)); We want a Dictionary\u0026lt;int, Stack\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;\u0026gt;, and we have already parsed the identifiers and put them into an array. The extension method Enumerable.ToDictionary creates a dictionary from an enumerable according to specified key and element selector functions. The key is going to be the stack identifier but for the element we want a new Stack\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;. The constructor accepts an initial capacity, so I set it to the maximum number of crates.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time to talk about stacks. They represent a last-in-first-out (LIFO) collection and the essential stack functions are:\npush: pushes a new value onto the stack pop: removes the first value off the stack and returns it peak: returns the first value without removing it LIFO means if we add A, B and C the value we get by using pop is C because it is the last-in and first-out. That being said, let\u0026rsquo;s parse those crates:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 var enumerable = lines.Take(lines.Length - 1).Reverse(); foreach (var line in enumerable) { var i = 0; foreach (var stackID in stackIDs) { var crate = line[i + 1]; i += 4; if (crate == \u0026#39; \u0026#39;) continue; stacks[stackID].Push(crate); } } LIFO means we have to use Enumerable.Reverse and read the crates from bottom to top. This way the last-in and first-out is the top crate. As for parsing I\u0026rsquo;m just using a counter i for the current position in the line and advance it by +4 for every stack. Why 4? Because [A] is 4 characters. Once again we can make our lives very easy because the input only has this format. We don\u0026rsquo;t have to make our code work with every possible input, only the one we have.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s recap really quick: we have parsed all rearrangement procedures and stacks. Now we just need to iterate over all procedures and apply them on the stacks:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 private static void ApplyProceduresOnStacks( IReadOnlyDictionary\u0026lt;int, Stack\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;\u0026gt; stacks, IEnumerable\u0026lt;RearrangementProcedure\u0026gt; procedures) { foreach (var procedure in procedures) { var fromStack = stacks[procedure.From]; var toStack = stacks[procedure.To]; var count = procedure.Count; foreach (var value in fromStack.Take(count)) { fromStack.Pop(); toStack.Push(value); } } } A Stack\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; in .NET implements IEnumerable\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; meaning we can also fully use LINQ on it. Instead of using a for-i loop we can use foreach and Enumerable.Take to take the required number of crates, pop them from the stack and push them onto the other stack.\nThe last thing we need is putting all of this together and printing out the result:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 public static async Task Main() { var input = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(\u0026#34;input.txt\u0026#34;, Encoding.UTF8); var split = input.Split(\u0026#34;\\n\\n\u0026#34;, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries); var stacks = CreateStacks(split[0]); var procedures = CreateRearrangementProcedures(split[1]); ApplyProceduresOnStacks(stacks, procedures); Console.WriteLine($\u0026#34;Part One: {CreateMessage(stacks)}\u0026#34;); } private static string CreateMessage(IReadOnlyDictionary\u0026lt;int, Stack\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;\u0026gt; stacks) { return stacks .Select(kv =\u0026gt; kv.Value) .Select(stack =\u0026gt; stack.First()) .Aggregate(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, (a, b) =\u0026gt; $\u0026#34;{a}{b}\u0026#34;); } Part Two Description As you watch the crane operator expertly rearrange the crates, you notice the process isn\u0026rsquo;t following your prediction.\nSome mud was covering the writing on the side of the crane, and you quickly wipe it away. The crane isn\u0026rsquo;t a CrateMover 9000 - it\u0026rsquo;s a CrateMover 9001.\nThe CrateMover 9001 is notable for many new and exciting features: air conditioning, leather seats, an extra cup holder, and the ability to pick up and move multiple crates at once.\nAgain considering the example above, the crates begin in the same configuration:\n1 2 3 4 [D] [N] [C] [Z] [M] [P] 1 2 3 Moving a single crate from stack 2 to stack 1 behaves the same as before:\n1 2 3 4 [D] [N] [C] [Z] [M] [P] 1 2 3 However, the action of moving three crates from stack 1 to stack 3 means that those three moved crates stay in the same order, resulting in this new configuration:\n1 2 3 4 5 [D] [N] [C] [Z] [M] [P] 1 2 3 Next, as both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1, they retain their order as well:\n1 2 3 4 5 [D] [N] [C] [Z] [M] [P] 1 2 3 Finally, a single crate is still moved from stack 1 to stack 2, but now it\u0026rsquo;s crate C that gets moved:\n1 2 3 4 5 [D] [N] [Z] [M] [C] [P] 1 2 3 In this example, the CrateMover 9001 has put the crates in a totally different order: MCD.\nBefore the rearrangement process finishes, update your simulation so that the Elves know where they should stand to be ready to unload the final supplies. After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?\nThe second part is so easy to implement, we literally just have to change two lines:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 var enumerable = isPartOne ? fromStack.Take(count).ToArray() : fromStack.Take(count).Reverse().ToArray(); foreach (var value in enumerable) { fromStack.Pop(); toStack.Push(value); } Conclusion The puzzles are starting to become more interesting. Looking at the subreddit and discussions a lot of people have issues with parsing the input this time around which is unsurprising, given how scary it initially looks.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zcxzdi/2022_day_5_yeah_the_9000_series_was_alright_and/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zd1hqy/2022_day_5_i_know_i_am_overthinking_it/\n","permalink":"https://erri120.github.io/posts/2022-12-05/","summary":"Day 5: Supply Stacks","title":"Advent of Code 2022: Day 5"},{"content":"Day 4 of the Advent of Code. If you have no idea what this is, check my post of the first day.\nDay 4: Camp Cleanup Links: Puzzle Page, My Code\nPart One Description Space needs to be cleared before the last supplies can be unloaded from the ships, and so several Elves have been assigned the job of cleaning up sections of the camp. Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.\nHowever, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, they\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that many of the assignments overlap. To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and make a big list of the section assignments for each pair (your puzzle input).\nFor example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 2-4,6-8 2-3,4-5 5-7,7-9 2-8,3-7 6-6,4-6 2-6,4-8 For the first few pairs, this list means:\nWithin the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections 2-4 (sections 2, 3, and 4), while the second Elf was assigned sections 6-8 (sections 6, 7, 8). The Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections. The Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got sections 5, 6, and 7, while the other also got 7, plus 8 and 9. This example list uses single-digit section IDs to make it easier to draw; your actual list might contain larger numbers. Visually, these pairs of section assignments look like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 .234..... 2-4 .....678. 6-8 .23...... 2-3 ...45.... 4-5 ....567.. 5-7 ......789 7-9 .2345678. 2-8 ..34567.. 3-7 .....6... 6-6 ...456... 4-6 .23456... 2-6 ...45678. 4-8 Some of the pairs have noticed that one of their assignments fully contains the other. For example, 2-8 fully contains 3-7, and 6-6 is fully contained by 4-6. In pairs where one assignment fully contains the other, one Elf in the pair would be exclusively cleaning sections their partner will already be cleaning, so these seem like the most in need of reconsideration. In this example, there are 2 such pairs.\nIn how many assignment pairs does one range fully contain the other?\nIt is time for ranges. We get a list of pairs of ranges and need to calculate how many pairs have ranges that fully contain the other. Let\u0026rsquo;s start by parsing the input which looks like this: 1-2,3-4\n1 2 3 var commaIndex = line.IndexOf(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;); var firstPart = line[..commaIndex]; var secondPart = line[(commaIndex + 1)..]; C# 8 added the Range operator which we can use on strings to create substrings. This is essentially the same as using String.Substring. In fact, C# will actually compile s[index..] into s.Substring(...). You can observe this behavior on SharpLab. The only thing you need be careful about are off-by-one errors which this puzzle has a lot of.\nThe code above will split the line 1-2,3-4 into two parts: 1-2 and 3-4. Next I want to create type to encapsulate these values:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 public readonly struct AssignmentRange { public readonly int Start; public readonly int End; public AssignmentRange(int start, int end) { Start = start; End = end; } public static AssignmentRange FromString(string s) { var dashIndex = s.IndexOf(\u0026#39;-\u0026#39;); var startIndex = int.Parse(s[..dashIndex]); var endIndex = int.Parse(s[(dashIndex + 1)..]); return new AssignmentRange(startIndex, endIndex); } public override string ToString() { return $\u0026#34;{Start}..{End}\u0026#34;; } } This is a readonly struct meaning the structure type is immutable, and all data members must have the readonly modifier. We don\u0026rsquo;t have to update these values, so a read-only struct makes sense. I also didn\u0026rsquo;t choose a class for this because classes are reference types and allocated on the heap. A structure is a value type and allocated on the stack. This is ideal for read-only small data types and can often lead to great performance improvements.\nThe struct also has a function to convert 1-2 into an assignment range. This is basically the same as before, but this time we split at a dash (-) instead of a comma (,).\nNow we have to add code that compares two ranges with each other:\n1 2 3 4 public bool ContainsOther(AssignmentRange other) { return Start \u0026lt;= other.Start \u0026amp;\u0026amp; End \u0026gt;= other.End; } This is an instance method of the struct and will check if the other range is contained in the current one. Finally, we put everything together:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 private static IEnumerable\u0026lt;(AssignmentRange, AssignmentRange)\u0026gt; ToRanges(this IEnumerable\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; lines) { return lines.Select(line =\u0026gt; { var commaIndex = line.IndexOf(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;); var firstPart = line[..commaIndex]; var secondPart = line[(commaIndex + 1)..]; var first = AssignmentRange.FromString(firstPart); var second = AssignmentRange.FromString(secondPart); return (first, second); }); } private static int PartOne(IEnumerable\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; lines) { var count = lines.ToRanges() .Select(tuple =\u0026gt; { var (first, second) = tuple; return first.ContainsOther(second) || second.ContainsOther(first); }).Count(x =\u0026gt; x); return count; } The method ToRanges is an Extension Method and will just convert the input lines into two assignment ranges. Other than the that the only thing of note is using Enumerable.Count that returns how many elements in the sequence satisfy our condition.\nPart Two Description It seems like there is still quite a bit of duplicate work planned. Instead, the Elves would like to know the number of pairs that overlap at all.\nIn the above example, the first two pairs (2-4,6-8 and 2-3,4-5) don\u0026rsquo;t overlap, while the remaining four pairs (5-7,7-9, 2-8,3-7, 6-6,4-6, and 2-6,4-8) do overlap:\n5-7,7-9 overlaps in a single section, 7. 2-8,3-7 overlaps all of the sections 3 through 7. 6-6,4-6 overlaps in a single section, 6. 2-6,4-8 overlaps in sections 4, 5, and 6. So, in this example, the number of overlapping assignment pairs is 4.\nIn how many assignment pairs do the ranges overlap?\nInstead of knowing if two ranges fully contain the other, we now check if two ranges overlap which is honestly easier:\n1 2 3 4 private static bool RangesOverlap(AssignmentRange a, AssignmentRange b) { return a.Start \u0026lt;= b.End \u0026amp;\u0026amp; b.Start \u0026lt;= a.End; } Conclusion https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zc19dz/2022_day_4_wait_i_have_to_clear_all_of_your/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zc4sdc/2022_day_4_mount_of_wasted_effort/\n","permalink":"https://erri120.github.io/posts/2022-12-04/","summary":"Day 4: Camp Cleanup","title":"Advent of Code 2022: Day 4"},{"content":"Day 3 of the Advent of Code. If you have no idea what this is, check my post of the first day.\nDay 3: Rucksack Reorganization Links: Puzzle Page, My Code\nPart One Description One Elf has the important job of loading all of the rucksacks with supplies for the jungle journey. Unfortunately, that Elf didn\u0026rsquo;t quite follow the packing instructions, and so a few items now need to be rearranged.\nEach rucksack has two large compartments. All items of a given type are meant to go into exactly one of the two compartments. The Elf that did the packing failed to follow this rule for exactly one item type per rucksack.\nThe Elves have made a list of all of the items currently in each rucksack (your puzzle input), but they need your help finding the errors. Every item type is identified by a single lowercase or uppercase letter (that is, a and A refer to different types of items).\nThe list of items for each rucksack is given as characters all on a single line. A given rucksack always has the same number of items in each of its two compartments, so the first half of the characters represent items in the first compartment, while the second half of the characters represent items in the second compartment.\nFor example, suppose you have the following list of contents from six rucksacks:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw The first rucksack contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp, which means its first compartment contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWr, while the second compartment contains the items hcsFMMfFFhFp. The only item type that appears in both compartments is lowercase p. The second rucksack\u0026rsquo;s compartments contain jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGL and rsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL. The only item type that appears in both compartments is uppercase L. The third rucksack\u0026rsquo;s compartments contain PmmdzqPrV and vPwwTWBwg; the only common item type is uppercase P. The fourth rucksack\u0026rsquo;s compartments only share item type v. The fifth rucksack\u0026rsquo;s compartments only share item type t. The sixth rucksack\u0026rsquo;s compartments only share item type s. To help prioritize item rearrangement, every item type can be converted to a priority:\nLowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26. Uppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52. In the above example, the priority of the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack is 16 (p), 38 (L), 42 (P), 22 (v), 20 (t), and 19 (s); the sum of these is 157.\nFind the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack. What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?\nWe went from calories to rock paper scissors and have now arrived at packing a backpack. The task is simple:\nfor each line: split the line in half find the intersection between the two halves calculate the priority sum up all the priorities This is honestly not much different from the puzzle of the first day and I once again reached for the power of LINQ:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 var lines = await File.ReadAllLinesAsync(\u0026#34;input.txt\u0026#34;, Encoding.UTF8); var summedPriorities = lines .Select(line =\u0026gt; { var firstCompartment = line[..(line.Length / 2)].ToHashSet(); var secondCompartment = line[(line.Length / 2)..].ToHashSet(); firstCompartment.IntersectWith(secondCompartment); return ToPriority(firstCompartment.First()); }).Sum(); return summedPriorities; We just do the usual projection with Enumerable.Select but instead of parsing numbers like in the first puzzle, this time we need to work with sets. A set is a collection that contains no duplicate elements, and whose elements are in no particular order. With .NET we have access to HashSet\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; which provides high-performance set operations.\nJust a quick reminder, set operations come from mathematics. The 3 most common set operations are:\nUnion (A ∪ B): produces a set of all things that belong to A or B or both Intersection (A ∩ B): produces a set of all things that belong to A and B Differences (A \\ B): produces a set of all things that belong to A, but not B In our case we want to find the characters that are in both compartments, so we use HashSet\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;.IntersectWith which modifies the current HashSet\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; to contain only elements that are present in itself and the specified collection (the other compartment).\nNow we only need to convert the character to a priority:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 private static int ToPriority(char c) { return c switch { \u0026gt;= \u0026#39;a\u0026#39; and \u0026lt;= \u0026#39;z\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; c - 96, \u0026gt;= \u0026#39;A\u0026#39; and \u0026lt;= \u0026#39;Z\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; c - 38, _ =\u0026gt; throw new UnreachableException() }; } Once again we are using the amazing C# 8 Pattern matching and the new switch expressions to calculate the right priority depending on the case of the character. A character can be converted to an integer however we need to offset it by a fixed amount. C# strings are UTF-16 encoded meaning a is 95, z is 122, A is 65 and Z is 90. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know how Encoding words, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a great post about it.\nPart Two Description As you finish identifying the misplaced items, the Elves come to you with another issue.\nFor safety, the Elves are divided into groups of three. Every Elf carries a badge that identifies their group. For efficiency, within each group of three Elves, the badge is the only item type carried by all three Elves. That is, if a group\u0026rsquo;s badge is item type B, then all three Elves will have item type B somewhere in their rucksack, and at most two of the Elves will be carrying any other item type.\nThe problem is that someone forgot to put this year\u0026rsquo;s updated authenticity sticker on the badges. All of the badges need to be pulled out of the rucksacks so the new authenticity stickers can be attached.\nAdditionally, nobody wrote down which item type corresponds to each group\u0026rsquo;s badges. The only way to tell which item type is the right one is by finding the one item type that is common between all three Elves in each group.\nEvery set of three lines in your list corresponds to a single group, but each group can have a different badge item type. So, in the above example, the first group\u0026rsquo;s rucksacks are the first three lines:\nvJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg And the second group\u0026rsquo;s rucksacks are the next three lines:\nwMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw In the first group, the only item type that appears in all three rucksacks is lowercase r; this must be their badges. In the second group, their badge item type must be Z.\nPriorities for these items must still be found to organize the sticker attachment efforts: here, they are 18 (r) for the first group and 52 (Z) for the second group. The sum of these is 70.\nFind the item type that corresponds to the badges of each three-Elf group. What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?\nPart Two requires us to find the intersection of 3 lines at once:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 private static int PartTwo(IEnumerable\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; lines) { var result = lines .Chunk(3) .Select(chunk =\u0026gt; chunk .Select(line =\u0026gt; line.ToHashSet()) .Aggregate((accumulate, next) =\u0026gt; { accumulate.IntersectWith(next); return accumulate; }) .Select(ToPriority) .First() ).Sum(); return result; } Aside from utilizing Enumerable.Chunk to split the lines into chunks of size 3, there isn\u0026rsquo;t much to explain here. The real hero is the Enumerable.Aggregate function. With aggregation, you apply an accumulator function over a sequence. Normally you have to specify a starting value of the accumulator but the overload function I used simply uses the first value of the sequence. This accumulator is then modified each iteration using HashSet\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;.IntersectWith, and finally we calculate the priority again and sum it all up.\nConclusion This puzzle was actually easier than the last one and only tests you on your set knowledge. I can definitely imagine how the second part might create some hideous code if you can\u0026rsquo;t properly chunk the lines with whatever language and libraries you might be using. Converting characters into integers is also a classic move and fits an early puzzle such as this perfectly.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zb8dag/2022_day_3_no_get_your_own_rucksack/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zbc2w5/elves_today_be_like/\n","permalink":"https://erri120.github.io/posts/2022-12-03/","summary":"Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization","title":"Advent of Code 2022: Day 3"},{"content":"Day 2 of the Advent of Code. If you have no idea what this is, check my post of the first day.\nDay 2: Rock Paper Scissors Links: Puzzle Page, My Code\nPart One Description The Elves begin to set up camp on the beach. To decide whose tent gets to be closest to the snack storage, a giant Rock Paper Scissors tournament is already in progress.\nRock Paper Scissors is a game between two players. Each game contains many rounds; in each round, the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand shape. Then, a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper defeats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.\nAppreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an encrypted strategy guide (your puzzle input) that they say will be sure to help you win. \u0026ldquo;The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors. The second column\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo; Suddenly, the Elf is called away to help with someone\u0026rsquo;s tent.\nThe second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors. Winning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have been carefully chosen.\nThe winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your total score is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).\nSince you can\u0026rsquo;t be sure if the Elf is trying to help you or trick you, you should calculate the score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.\nFor example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:\n1 2 3 A Y B X C Z This strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:\nIn the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won). In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 + 0). The third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6. In this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).\nWhat would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time for everyone\u0026rsquo;s favorite game \u0026ldquo;Rock paper scissors\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;Schere, Stein, Papier\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;Pierre-papier-ciseaux\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;Piedra, papel o tijera\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;じゃんけん\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;石头、剪子、布.\u0026rdquo;\nOur first objective is using the strategy guide we get from an elf to play in the tournament. The guide contains two columns:\nwhat the opponent plays what we should play For this puzzle we need to calculate the total score if we followed the guide.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with the basics and define some Enums:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 public enum RoundOutcome { Lost = 0, Draw = 3, Won = 6 } public enum Shape { Rock = 1, Paper = 2, Scissors = 3 } An enumeration type in C# is just a set of named constants that map to an underlying integer value. Normally the compiler will just auto-generate the value but in our case we want to explicitly specify it. For the RoundOutcome I\u0026rsquo;m using points we get when the round is lost, a draw or won and for Shape it\u0026rsquo;s the points we get for playing this shape.\nNext we need a function that calculates the round outcome given the opponent input and our input:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 private static RoundOutcome CalculateRoundOutcome(char opponentInput, char playerInput) { var opponentShape = opponentInput switch { \u0026#39;A\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; Shape.Rock, \u0026#39;B\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; Shape.Paper, \u0026#39;C\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; Shape.Scissors, _ =\u0026gt; throw new UnreachableException() }; var playerShape = playerInput switch { \u0026#39;X\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; Shape.Rock, \u0026#39;Y\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; Shape.Paper, \u0026#39;Z\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; Shape.Scissors, _ =\u0026gt; throw new UnreachableException() }; //... } Let\u0026rsquo;s start by mapping the raw input we read from the file to our Shape enum. Notice the UnreachableException at the end of the switch statement? This is a new exception in .NET 7 that is thrown when the program executes an instruction that was thought to be unreachable. In our case we have pre-defined inputs and anything else should not match.\nNext we just need to add the rules of the game:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 if (opponentShape == playerShape) return RoundOutcome.Draw; return (opponentShape, playerShape) switch { (Shape.Rock, Shape.Paper) =\u0026gt; RoundOutcome.Won, (Shape.Rock, Shape.Scissors) =\u0026gt; RoundOutcome.Lost, (Shape.Paper, Shape.Rock) =\u0026gt; RoundOutcome.Lost, (Shape.Paper, Shape.Scissors) =\u0026gt; RoundOutcome.Won, (Shape.Scissors, Shape.Rock) =\u0026gt; RoundOutcome.Won, (Shape.Scissors, Shape.Paper) =\u0026gt; RoundOutcome.Lost, _ =\u0026gt; throw new UnreachableException() }; These are just the basic rules of the game: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Rock. If the players have the same shape it\u0026rsquo;s a draw. The only cool thing about this code is the utilization of Pattern matching and the new switch expressions we got in C# 8.\nWith the rules in place we just need to calculate the final round score:\n1 2 3 4 5 private static int RoundScore(RoundOutcome outcome, Shape playedShape) { var shapePoints = (int)playedShape; return shapePoints + (int)outcome; } Our enumeration types are just named integers, and we can freely convert between them. The only thing left to do is read the file and get the total score:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 public static async Task Main() { var totalScore = (await File.ReadAllLinesAsync(\u0026#34;input.txt\u0026#34;, Encoding.UTF8)) .Where(line =\u0026gt; !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(line)) .Select(line =\u0026gt; { var opponentInput = line[0]; var playerInput = line[2]; var outcome = CalculateRoundOutcome(opponentInput, playerInput); return RoundScore(outcome, playerShape); }) .Sum(); Console.WriteLine($\u0026#34;Total Score: {totalScore}\u0026#34;); } This solution is okay. With puzzles like these it\u0026rsquo;s always good to implement a naive solution first in order to understand the problem and figure out the correct value. What I don\u0026rsquo;t like about the code is the massive switch expression where the match the opponent shape and the player shape to figure out the round outcome. So here is a more interesting approach using math:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 var opponentValue = (int)opponentShape; var playerValue = (int)playerShape; if (opponentValue == playerValue) return RoundOutcome.Draw; return opponentValue % 3 + 1 == playerValue ? RoundOutcome.Won : RoundOutcome.Lost; First we cast the shape enumeration value to an integer (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, 3 for Scissors). A draw is the easiest case to check for since it\u0026rsquo;s just the same input, but how do know if someone won or lost with just numbers? Let\u0026rsquo;s write out every situation and look at the results:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 1 -\u0026gt; draw 2 2 -\u0026gt; draw 3 3 -\u0026gt; draw 1 2 -\u0026gt; won 2 3 -\u0026gt; won 3 1 -\u0026gt; won 1 3 -\u0026gt; lost 2 1 -\u0026gt; lost 3 2 -\u0026gt; lost There is a pattern for the values that win us the game: if the opponent\u0026rsquo;s value offset by 1 and wrapped around to 1 is equal to the player\u0026rsquo;s value, we win.\nPart Two Description The Elf finishes helping with the tent and sneaks back over to you. \u0026ldquo;Anyway, the second column says how the round needs to end: X means you need to lose, Y means you need to end the round in a draw, and Z means you need to win. Good luck!\u0026rdquo;\nThe total score is still calculated in the same way, but now you need to figure out what shape to choose so the round ends as indicated. The example above now goes like this:\nIn the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you need the round to end in a draw (Y), so you also choose Rock. This gives you a score of 1 + 3 = 4. In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you choose Rock so you lose (X) with a score of 1 + 0 = 1. In the third round, you will defeat your opponent\u0026rsquo;s Scissors with Rock for a score of 1 + 6 = 7. Now that you\u0026rsquo;re correctly decrypting the ultra top secret strategy guide, you would get a total score of 12.\nFollowing the Elf\u0026rsquo;s instructions for the second column, what would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?\nIn Part Two it turns out we misinterpreted the guide and instead of the second column giving us shape to play, it\u0026rsquo;s the outcome we want. Using our newly gained knowledge from the previous part about numbers, we can easily calculate which shape we need to play to get the desired outcome:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 private static int PartTwoScore(char opponent, char predictedOutcome) { var opponentShape = OpponentShape(opponent); var opponentValue = (int)opponentShape; var outcome = predictedOutcome switch { \u0026#39;X\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; RoundOutcome.Lost, \u0026#39;Y\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; RoundOutcome.Draw, \u0026#39;Z\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; RoundOutcome.Won, _ =\u0026gt; throw new UnreachableException() }; var playerValue = outcome switch { RoundOutcome.Lost =\u0026gt; opponentValue == 1 ? 3 : opponentValue - 1, RoundOutcome.Won =\u0026gt; opponentValue % 3 + 1, RoundOutcome.Draw =\u0026gt; (int)opponentShape, _ =\u0026gt; throw new UnreachableException() }; var playerShape = (Shape)playerValue; return RoundScore(outcome, playerShape); } We know the opponent\u0026rsquo;s shape and the round outcome we want. The only thing we need is the player shape which we can get by using the pattern we discovered in part one. The only thing remaining is to update our main function:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 public static async Task Main() { var scores = (await File.ReadAllLinesAsync(\u0026#34;input.txt\u0026#34;, Encoding.UTF8)) .Where(line =\u0026gt; !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(line)) .Select(line =\u0026gt; { var a = line[0]; var b = line[2]; var partOne = PartOneScore(a, b); var partTwo = PartTwoScore(a, b); return (partOne, partTwo); }) .ToArray(); var partOneTotalScore = scores.Select(x =\u0026gt; x.partOne).Sum(); var partTwoTotalScore = scores.Select(x =\u0026gt; x.partTwo).Sum(); Console.WriteLine($\u0026#34;Part One - Total Score: {partOneTotalScore}\u0026#34;); Console.WriteLine($\u0026#34;Part Two - Total Score: {partTwoTotalScore}\u0026#34;); } Conclusion This puzzle is very interesting. You can go for the speedrun strategy and use pattern matching to quickly solve this puzzle or take more time to think and realize you can just use numbers. The previous puzzles will likely look similar in every implementation but here you can experiment more and come up with some crazy ideas. It will be interesting to see how the Brainfuck implementation will look like.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zahemk/2022_day_2_data_structures_good_control_flow_bad\n","permalink":"https://erri120.github.io/posts/2022-12-02/","summary":"Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors","title":"Advent of Code 2022: Day 2"},{"content":"Advent of Code is an advent calendar of programming puzzles. Starting on December 1st and ending on December 25th, you will get a puzzle every day and have to solve it. This is the 8th time the event happened, and I will be documenting my solutions here. The code can be found on GitHub.\nDay 1: Calorie Counting Links: Puzzle Page, My Code\nPart One Description The jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves\u0026rsquo; expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).\nThe Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they\u0026rsquo;ve brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf\u0026rsquo;s inventory (if any) by a blank line.\nFor example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items\u0026rsquo; Calories and end up with the following list:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000 This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:\nThe first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories. The second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories. The third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories. The fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories. The fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories. In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they\u0026rsquo;d like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the fourth Elf).\nFind the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?\nThe first puzzle of the event has always been the easiest, but difficulty will ramp up in later puzzles. For now, we are given a text file and need to do some additions. I have chosen to go with C# for this puzzle because LINQ is really powerful and ideal for this situation.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with a naive approach to the problem:\nread the text file iterate over every line for each line: add number to counter if the line is empty: add the current counter value to a list reset the counter to 0 take the biggest value of the list as a solution In C# the implementation would look something like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 var contents = await File.ReadAllLinesAsync(\u0026#34;input.txt\u0026#34;, Encoding.UTF8); var elves = new List\u0026lt;int\u0026gt;(); var currentCalories = 0; foreach (var line in contents) { if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(line)) { elves.Add(currentCalories); currentCalories = 0; continue; } var calories = int.Parse(line); currentCalories += calories; } Console.WriteLine($\u0026#34;Elf with most Calories: {elves.Max()}\u0026#34;); The LINQ extension method Enumerable.Max returns the maximum value in a sequence of values which is exactly what we need for the puzzle. While this solution works and is easy to understand, we can make it more concise and fully utilize LINQ:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 var mostCalories = (await File.ReadAllTextAsync(\u0026#34;input.txt\u0026#34;, Encoding.UTF8)) .Split(\u0026#34;\\n\\n\u0026#34;) .Select(chunk =\u0026gt; chunk .Split(\u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries) .Select(line =\u0026gt; int.Parse(line)) .Sum()) .Max(); Console.WriteLine($\u0026#34;Elf with most Calories: {mostCalories}\u0026#34;); Instead of using ReadAllLinesAsync which returns all lines in a string array string[], we can use ReadAllTextAsync and use String.Split to create chunks of the input. Remember that each elf is separated by an empty line, so we can split at \\n\\n to create the chunks we need.\nAfter the split we now have an enumerable sequence of chunks (IEnumerable\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;) which we need to project into something different. The Enumerable.Select does exactly that. The chunk variable within the lambda will look something like this:\n1 2 3 1000 2000 4000 With another use of String.Split we create a sequence of lines where we use Enumerable.Select to parse 1000 into an integer. Finally, we use Enumerable.Sum to compute the sum of the sequence because we don\u0026rsquo;t want a sequence of calories for each elf but the total calories each elf is carrying.\nTo answer the question of how many total calories the elf with the most calories is carrying we can use Enumerable.Max to get the maximum value. This solution showcases the power of LINQ and how you can get very creative with it.\nPart Two Description By the time you calculate the answer to the Elves\u0026rsquo; question, they\u0026rsquo;ve already realized that the Elf carrying the most Calories of food might eventually run out of snacks.\nTo avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would instead like to know the total Calories carried by the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they still have two backups.\nIn the example above, the top three Elves are the fourth Elf (with 24000 Calories), then the third Elf (with 11000 Calories), then the fifth Elf (with 10000 Calories). The sum of the Calories carried by these three elves is 45000.\nFind the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. How many Calories are those Elves carrying in total?\nMost puzzles in the event will consists of multiple parts. These parts always require the previous solution before being accessible and only require minor code changes. With our LINQ solution we only need to change a little:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 var elves = (await File.ReadAllTextAsync(\u0026#34;input.txt\u0026#34;, Encoding.UTF8)) .Split(\u0026#34;\\n\\n\u0026#34;) .Select(chunk =\u0026gt; chunk .Split(\u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries) .Select(line =\u0026gt; int.Parse(line)) .Sum()) .Order() .ToArray(); Console.WriteLine($\u0026#34;Elf with most Calories: {elves.Last()}\u0026#34;); Console.WriteLine($\u0026#34;Top 3 Elves combined: {elves.TakeLast(3).Sum()}\u0026#34;); Instead of only getting the maximum total calories, we also want the combined total calories of the top 3 elves. Since we already have the total calories of each elf, we just need to order the sequence and take the biggest values. Note that Enumerable.Order sorts the elements in ascending order meaning the biggest values are last. This is why we need to use Enumerable.Last to get the last element and Enumerable.TakeLast to get the last 3 values which are the 3 biggest ones.\nConclusion This is just the first and easiest puzzle from the event and a good puzzle for people getting started with programming. It will be interesting to see how hard future puzzles will become.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/z9g0i0/ai_imagine_advent_of_code_2022_day_1/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/z9fltg/sigh_47000_calories_coming_right_up_sir/\n","permalink":"https://erri120.github.io/posts/2022-12-01/","summary":"Day 1: Calorie Counting","title":"Advent of Code 2022: Day 1"},{"content":"Following my post on Character encodings and Unicode it is now time to talk about i18n with GNU gettext. We will look at i18n and l10n in general and then talk about how gettext can make our live as programmers very easy.\ni18n and l10n - Internationalization and Localization Due to the length of Internationalization and Localization you can just write i18n and l10n which are \u0026ldquo;numeronyms\u0026rdquo;, number based words that are formed by taking the first and last character of the words and putting the amount of letters between these two characters in the middle, so for Internationalization it starts with an i and ends with an n and has 18 letters in-between resulting in i18n.\nFor us software developers these terms mean adapting our code to be locale agnostic. If you create a UI and hard-code all strings then the users won\u0026rsquo;t be able to change the language. Aside from normal translations i18n and l10n also encompasses formatting rules for numbers, date and time, currency and things like text layout. Some languages read left to right, others right to left. Instead of reading horizontally there are also cultures where you read vertically.\nAll of this might seem overwhelming and in reality you will likely never have to deal with this. For Open-Source projects it\u0026rsquo;s often enough to just have everything in English and maybe provide a way to load translations.\nGNU gettext and libintl i18n and l10n is all nice and good, but how should we programmers design our software to support these concepts? This is where gettext and libintl come into play.\nIn 1995 the GNU projects released GNU gettext into the world. The package offers an integrated set of tools as well as the libintl runtime library for dealing with translations. We will take a look at the tools xgettext, msginit, msgmerge and msgfmt, how to use the gettext library in our code and what the process of creating translations is.\nCMake Setup In order for us to use libintl in our code we need to get it from somewhere. In this example we will use CMake and vcpkg.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8) project ( \u0026#34;CppInternationalization\u0026#34; VERSION 1.0.0 LANGUAGES CXX ) # Using C++20 set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20) set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON) set(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF) add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} \u0026#34;main.cpp\u0026#34;) # add libintl find_package(Intl REQUIRED) target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ${Intl_LIBRARY}) target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ${Intl_INCLUDE_DIRS}) This is a very basic CMakeLists.txt file containing one dependency which we will get with vcpkg using vcpkg install gettext[tools]. The tools feature is very important so we can get the programs required for our setup.\nCode Setup 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 #include \u0026lt;iostream\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;cstdlib\u0026gt; int main() { std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; std::endl; return EXIT_SUCCESS; } This is the most basic C++ program possible. In the code we hard-coded the string Hello World!, and now we want to provide translations. The libintl runtime library has exactly what we need:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 #include \u0026lt;iostream\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;cstdlib\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;libintl.h\u0026gt; int main() { std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; gettext(\u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; std::endl; return EXIT_SUCCESS; } The gettext function from the libintl.h header will now look for a translation of the string Hello World! for the current locale at runtime. If it does not find a translation it will just use Hello World! which is very nice since we only have to wrap all the strings in gettext(). If gettext is too long you can create a macro:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 #include \u0026lt;iostream\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;cstdlib\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;libintl.h\u0026gt; #define _(String) gettext(String) int main() { std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; _(\u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; std::endl; return EXIT_SUCCESS; } This macro is very commonly used in projects that use GNU gettext and even included in frameworks like GTK.\nSo where does gettext() look for my translations? You will have to specify that with bindtextdomain:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 #include \u0026lt;iostream\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;cstdlib\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;libintl.h\u0026gt; #define _(String) gettext(String) int main() { bindtextdomain(\u0026#34;my-domain\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;locales\u0026#34;); textdomain(\u0026#34;my-domain\u0026#34;); std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; _(\u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; std::endl; return EXIT_SUCCESS; } Now at runtime if the user has the de locale set, gettext() will look at locales/de/LC_MESSAGES/my-domain.mo for a translation. Let\u0026rsquo;s break this path down:\nlocales: the folder specified in bindtextdomain de: the current locale LC_MESSAGES: the category name of the translation my-domain.mo: the binary message catalog containing all translations. The file name is what you specified in bindtextdomain as well as textdomain There are few things that need explaining. The library will first try and find an exact match of the current locale but if that is not possible it will look for similar locales. As an example if the user has de_DE, but you only provided de then the library will first look for de_DE and when it doesn\u0026rsquo;t find it, it will look for an expanded locale like de.\nThe LC_MESSAGES part of the path is the category name of the translation we are looking for. LC stands for locale category and there are various others like LC_CTYPE, LC_NUMERIC, LC_TIME, LC_MONETARY which all specify how to handle various things like numbers, dates and currency. For our purposes we only focus on messages, raw strings or texts we want to translate. gettext will always use LC_MESSAGES as its category. There are other functions that will let you specify which category you want to look for like dcgettext but for this post we won\u0026rsquo;t look at those.\nThe .mo file is the message catalog which has to be generated. So let\u0026rsquo;s look at how that works next.\nInitial Project Setup In our very complex example we have marked the Hello World! string as a translatable string. We can now use xgettext to extract these marked strings:\n1 xgettext main.cpp --keyword=\u0026#34;_\u0026#34; --output=\u0026#34;locales/my-domain.pot\u0026#34; This .pot file is a Portable Object Template file. It can look like this:\n# SOME DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. # FIRST AUTHOR \u0026lt;EMAIL@ADDRESS\u0026gt;, YEAR. # #, fuzzy msgid \u0026#34;\u0026#34; msgstr \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026#34;POT-Creation-Date: 2022-05-05 14:47+0200\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;PO-Revision-Date: YEAR-MO-DA HO:MI+ZONE\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Last-Translator: FULL NAME \u0026lt;EMAIL@ADDRESS\u0026gt;\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Language-Team: LANGUAGE \u0026lt;LL@li.org\u0026gt;\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Language: \\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;MIME-Version: 1.0\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Content-Type: text/plain; charset=CHARSET\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\\n\u0026#34; #: main.cpp:10 msgid \u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34; msgstr \u0026#34;\u0026#34; At the bottom you can find our Hello World! string which comes from main.cpp at line 10. This file can now be used to create .po, Portable Object files using msginit:\n1 msginit --input=\u0026#34;locales/my-domain.pot\u0026#34; --output-file=\u0026#34;locales/de/my-domain.po\u0026#34; --locale=\u0026#34;de\u0026#34; Every language you want to support gets its own .po file. The .pot is just a template used to create the .po files with. The .po file looks almost the same:\nmsgid \u0026#34;\u0026#34; msgstr \u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026#34;POT-Creation-Date: 2022-05-05 14:47+0200\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;PO-Revision-Date: 2022-05-04 18:41+0200\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Last-Translator: \u0026lt;EMAIL@ADDRESS\u0026gt;\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Language-Team: German\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Language: de\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;MIME-Version: 1.0\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Content-Type: text/plain; charset=CP1252\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Plural-Forms: nplurals=2; plural=(n != 1);\\n\u0026#34; \u0026#34;X-Generator: Poedit 3.0.1\\n\u0026#34; #: main.cpp:10 msgid \u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34; msgstr \u0026#34;Hallo Welt!\u0026#34; I already went ahead and translated Hello World! to Hallo Welt! using Poedit, but there are other tools like KBabel, Gtranslator, PO Mode and more which you can use to edit the .po files. The ecosystem is very mature and platforms like transifex also support it.\nNow with your fully or partially translated .po file in hand we will use msgfmt to create our final output file:\n1 msgfmt \u0026#34;locales/de/my-domain.po\u0026#34; --output-file=\u0026#34;locales/de/my-domain.mo\u0026#34; You now have a .mo file that can be loaded at runtime. But what happens when you change your code? How do you update your .pot, .po and .mo files when there are new, removed or changed strings in your code?\nSource changed, what to do? What we looked at so far is the initial setup phase. This is what you do when you have no previous .pot or .po files and generate them for the first time. If you already have them and the code changed you need to run xgettext again:\n1 xgettext main.cpp --keyword=\u0026#34;_\u0026#34; --output=\u0026#34;locales/my-domain.pot\u0026#34; The .pot file can be overwritten as you please since it only holds generated content. The .po files are more important since you don\u0026rsquo;t want to re-do all translations. For this reason we use msgmerge to update the .po files with the new template:\n1 msgmerge \u0026#34;locales/de/my-domain.po\u0026#34; \u0026#34;locales/my-domain.pot\u0026#34; --output-file=\u0026#34;locales/de/my-domain.po\u0026#34; The tool takes the current .po file and the new .pot file as input and spits out an updated .po file that keeps your existing translations as long as they are still used.\nAutomating and integrating with CMake If you found all of this extremely tedious to do by hand then you are not alone. Of course we can automate the generating and updating for all the required files as well as copying the .mo files to our output at build time using a CMake script.\nTo get started, grab a copy this script or add the repository as a submodule. In your CMakeLists.txt file we need to add some lines:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # setup gettext set(GETTEXT_DOMAIN \u0026#34;my-domain\u0026#34;) set(GETTEXT_TARGET \u0026#34;gettext-target\u0026#34;) set(GETTEXT_OUTPUT_DIR \u0026#34;locales\u0026#34;) set(GETTEXT_LANGUAGES \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; \u0026#34;de\u0026#34;) target_compile_definitions(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC \u0026#34;GETTEXT_DOMAIN=\\\u0026#34;${GETTEXT_DOMAIN}\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) target_compile_definitions(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC \u0026#34;GETTEXT_OUTPUT_DIR=\\\u0026#34;${GETTEXT_OUTPUT_DIR}\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) First we specify some variables and add GETTEXT_DOMAIN and GETTEXT_OUTPUT_DIR as a predefined macro so we can use it in our code. I suggest you change the domain name and the list of languages you want to use.\nNext we want to add the previously downloaded script:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 include(\u0026#34;extern/gettext-cmake/Gettext_helpers.cmake\u0026#34;) CONFIGURE_GETTEXT( DOMAIN ${GETTEXT_DOMAIN} TARGET_NAME ${GETTEXT_TARGET} SOURCES \u0026#34;main.cpp\u0026#34; POTFILE_DESTINATION ${GETTEXT_OUTPUT_DIR} XGETTEXT_ARGS \u0026#34;--keyword=_\u0026#34; \u0026#34;--add-comments=TRANSLATORS:\u0026#34; \u0026#34;--package-name=${PROJECT_NAME}\u0026#34; \u0026#34;--package-version=${PROJECT_VERSION}\u0026#34; \u0026#34;--msgid-bugs-address=\u0026lt;https://github.com/erri120/${PROJECT_NAME}/issues\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \u0026#34;--copyright-holder=erri120\u0026#34; LANGUAGES ${GETTEXT_LANGUAGES} BUILD_DESTINATION $\u0026lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:${PROJECT_NAME}\u0026gt;/${GETTEXT_OUTPUT_DIR} ALL ) There is lots to configure so let\u0026rsquo;s go through it all:\nDOMAIN set the domain name TARGET_NAME: set the CMake target name SOURCES: set a list of all source files that xgettext should look through, I suggest creating some variable that holds all your sources POTFILE_DESTINATION: this is the directory where the .pot file goes XGETTEXT_ARGS: most of the extra arguments supplied are just for flavor like specifying the package name, version as well as the address where you can report bugs and the copyright holder LANGAUGES: set the list of languages we want to support BUILD_DESTINATION: the top-level output folder for the generated .mo files ALL: adds the custom CMake target to the default build target so that it will be run every time And that\u0026rsquo;s it. Doing a CMake configure will generate the .pot and .po files, and you now have some new targets that will generate the .mo files.\nComplete Code Example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 #include \u0026lt;iostream\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;cstdlib\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;libintl.h\u0026gt; #if WIN32 #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN #include \u0026lt;Windows.h\u0026gt; #endif #define _(STRING) gettext(STRING) static void setup_i18n(const std::string_view locale) { #if WIN32 // LocaleNameToLCID requires a LPCWSTR so we need to convert from char to wchar_t const auto wStringSize = MultiByteToWideChar(CP_UTF8, 0, locale.data(), static_cast\u0026lt;int\u0026gt;(locale.length()), nullptr, 0); std::wstring localeName; localeName.reserve(wStringSize); MultiByteToWideChar(CP_UTF8, 0, locale.data(), static_cast\u0026lt;int\u0026gt;(locale.length()), localeName.data(), wStringSize); _configthreadlocale(_DISABLE_PER_THREAD_LOCALE); const auto localeId = LocaleNameToLCID(localeName.c_str(), LOCALE_ALLOW_NEUTRAL_NAMES); SetThreadLocale(localeId); #else setlocale(LC_MESSAGES, locale.data()); #endif bindtextdomain(GETTEXT_DOMAIN, GETTEXT_OUTPUT_DIR); bind_textdomain_codeset(GETTEXT_DOMAIN, \u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;); textdomain(GETTEXT_DOMAIN); } int main() { setup_i18n(\u0026#34;de\u0026#34;); std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; _(\u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; std::endl; return EXIT_SUCCESS; } Woah, what happened with our 12 lines of code? Things are sadly not as easy as you want them to be. The main function is still the same, we have our marked string Hello World! but now there is the new function setup_i18n.\nThis new function takes a std::string_view as an argument and sets the current locale to something new. In this case I want to change the locale to de so my German translation for Hello World! can be loaded. In your actual code you\u0026rsquo;d want to have some language option the user can change which would call this function with the new locale.\nThe thing that makes this messy is of course the difference between systems. On a POSIX compliant system you can just call setlocale(LC_MESSAGES, \u0026quot;de\u0026quot;), but this doesn\u0026rsquo;t work at all for Windows.\nOn Windows you need to use SetThreadLocale which requires a locale ID that you can get from a name like de using LocaleNameToLCID. The _configthreadlocale(_DISABLE_PER_THREAD_LOCALE) call is important because SetThreadLocale only affects the current thread, who would have thought, so we want to disable this behavior and change the locale of this and all future threads.\nThe code after that uses the new predefined macros we added in our CMake file and I also added a call to the very useful bind_textdomain_codeset function. I suggest reading my Character encodings and Unicode where I explain the mess that is Code Pages and Unicode. With this function call gettext will always return a UTF-8 string. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want that or don\u0026rsquo;t need that you can remove this call but for frameworks like GTK it is required as they accept UTF-8 only.\nAlternatives GNU gettext has been around for over 30 years, it is battle tested, has great support and a matured ecosystem. However, if this is not for you or if you can\u0026rsquo;t use it there are a few alternatives available:\nDIY: always possible but highly discouraged Qt: of course the Qt-ecosystem has a different way of doing translations ICU: International Components for Unicode have ICU4C however it is not easy to use at all Boost.Locale they use ICU as a backend POSIX: catgets this was created back in 1987 before GNU gettext Win32: LoadString with this you can load string resources by ID ","permalink":"https://erri120.github.io/posts/2022-05-05/","summary":"GNU gettext is a very useful i18n and l10n tool that makes it easy to add translations in our code.","title":"Getting started with GNU gettext for C++"},{"content":"Time and Character encoding are the two things a programmer never wants to touch. Thankfully dealing with time has been made very easy, we developed ISO Standards, created standard libraries with good time functions and don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry until 2038 when a signed 32-bit integer is unable to hold the number of seconds elapsed since the Unix epoch.\nCharacter encodings did not receive this kind of treatment until the emergence of Unicode but even then we still have massive issues when dealing with them.\nHistory If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to read through this history class I prepared, you can skip directly to the more interesting topic here: Encoding, Code Pages and Unicode for Programmers.\nElectrical Telegraphy One of the earliest encoding methods is Morse Code which was introduced in the 1840s. The earliest code used commercially was the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph five needle code, aka C\u0026amp;W5, but no one really used it. Instead, each country went ahead and developed their own code leading to the creation of the American Morse Code:\n1911 Chart of the Standard American Morse Characters from the American School of Correspondence\nThis code had issues so a fellow German named Friedrich Clemens Gerke developed a modified version in 1848 for use on German railways. At that time many central European countries belonged to the German-Austrian Telegraph Union and they quickly decided to adopt this version across all its countries in 1851.\nDue to the widespread use of the Gerke Code it became the International Morse Code in 1865:\nChart of the Morse code letters and numerals by Rhey T. Snodgrass \u0026amp; Victor F. Camp, 1922\nEven though it is called the \u0026ldquo;International\u0026rdquo; Morse Code, US companies refused to adopt it and continued to use the American Morse Code. They didn\u0026rsquo;t want to re-train their operators and because the telegraph was not state controlled but multiple private companies worked together, they never adopted it.\nSo why am I telling you this 180-year-old story? Back then we already were unable to come to a consensus on what standard to use. The Gerke Code was adopted by the German-Austrian Telegraph Union, but each country developed their own Code at some point because they used special characters in their language. This has been the biggest problem throughout the years. In Europe, we mostly use Latin-based alphabets but over in Asia things looked different:\nObsolete Chinese telegraph codes from Septime Auguste Viguier’s New Book for the Telegraph\nThis is one page from the Chinese Telegraph Code book. There are nearly 10 thousand characters in this book.\nThis is another recurring theme across history. Languages use different alphabets or none at all. A Logography uses written characters that represent a word or morpheme, like Chinese characters. This makes creating encodings for use everywhere really hard because now you don\u0026rsquo;t have 26 letters in lower and uppercase and a few syntax characters, but thousands of characters that have their own meaning. Most of the technological advancements in telegraphy and digital computers happened in Europe or USA, Asia was often left out and new encodings would focus on Latin-based alphabets.\nAutomatic Telegraphy In 1846 someone had the genius idea of automatically generating Morse code. Previously if you want to transmit a message, you\u0026rsquo;d go through each letter, look at the Morse Code table and press the required taps.\nBut what if you had a machine with multiple keys where each key corresponds to a different entry in the Morse Code table? A machine with multiple keys where each input corresponds to a different output, where have I heard that before? How about a piano:\nHughes Letter-Printing Telegraph Set built by Siemens and Halske in Saint Petersburg, Russia, ca.1900\nPiano keyboards existed for a long time and are really easy to understand. If you want to transmit an A you just press the key that is marked with an A. No need to look into some weird table and get hand pain by pressing the same key in different intervals for the entire day.\nBut let us not get side-tracked by random history and focus on out main topic: encoding. With these new printing telegraphs the operator stopped sending dots and dashes directly with a single key but instead operated a piano keyboard and a machine which would generated the appropriate Morse Code Point based on the key pressed.\nThe Morse Code was designed to be used by humans meaning common letters were easier to \u0026ldquo;type\u0026rdquo; by requiring fewer inputs. In the 1870s Émile Baudot created a new Code to be used by machines instead of humans to make sending and receiving even easier:\nPart of the patent from 1888 (US388244)\nThe Baudot Code is a 5-bit fixed-length binary code and next most important invention after the Morse Code. It is also known as the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 1 (ITA1).\nIf there is a No. 1, there must be a No. 2, so in 1901 Donal Murray modified Baudot Code to create the Murray Code. This code was used with punched paper tape. Now a reperforator could be used to make a perforated copy of received messages and a tape transmitter can send messages from punched tapes. Instead of directly transmitting to the line, the key presses of the operator would punch holes instead, making transmitting multiple messages from one tape very fast.\nOperator fatigue was no longer an issue, instead Murray focused on minimizing machine wear and had to add control characters to control the machine. These characters are Carriage Return and Line Feed also known as CR and LF. If you every wondered where those came from, now you know.\nIn 1924 the International Telegraph Union created the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2), based on Murray Code, which became the most widespread code as nearly all 20th-century teleprinter equipment used ITA2 or some variant of it.\n1960s ITA2 was very successful but we were going digital. Here are some inventions from this era to paint a picture: IBM created the IBM 704 in 1954 which was the first mass-produced computer with floating-point arithmetic hardware, the first transatlantic communications cable was laid down in 1956 and MIT and Bell Labs created the first Modem in 1959.\nThings started to become digital and electronics became more important. Teleprinter technology also advanced and people wanted to use lowercase characters and additional punctuations. In 1964 the American Standards Association created the famous 7-bit ASCII Code also known as US-ASCII:\nIBM and Code Pages IBM with their mainframe computers played a very important role for us. They were a chief proponent of the ASCII standardization committee however they did not have enough time to prepare ASCII peripherals to ship with the IBM System/360 in 1964. This was a big problem and the company instead created the Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) which is an 8-bit character set.\nThe IBM System/360 was extremely successful and EBCDIC shared in this success. This was a problem, you now have ASCII which IBM really liked and EBCDIC which was used everywhere because everyone used the IBM System/360. Further complications arose since EBCDIC and ASCII were not compatible with each other which resulted in issues when transferring data between systems.\nWith EBCDIC came these new things called Code Pages. Not everyone speaks English and as we have seen before, some languages use a Latin-based alphabet, some use a non-Latin-based alphabet some don\u0026rsquo;t use an alphabet at all but Logography instead. Not only that but we are currently in the late 20th century when 20-megabyte drives costs 250 USD meaning we have to be space efficient.\nFor these reasons, IBM created code pages for the EBCDIC character set which are represented by a number and change the way you encode certain characters. One important thing I want to mention is that IBM created the code pages but not the standard that was behind it. As an example let\u0026rsquo;s look at JIS X 0201 which is a Japanese Industrial Standard developed in 1969 and was implemented by IBM as Code Page 897. IBM did not create the standard, they only created the code page that implemented it.\n8-bit architecture In the 1980s the 8-bit architecture led to the 8-bit byte becoming the standard unit of computer storage, so ASCII with its 7-bit length was inconvenient for data retrieval. Thus, in 1987 we got the standard ISO 8859-1 aka Extended ASCII which uses the extra bit for more non-English characters like accented vowels and some currency symbols.\nGoing Unicode It is the year 1980 and a company named Xerox created the Xerox Character Code Standard (XCCS) which is 16-bit and encodes the characters required for languages using the Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek and Cyrillic scripts, the Chinese, Japanese and Korean writing systems, and technical symbols.\nA group with members of Xerox and Apple started thinking about a universal character set in 1987 and used the XCCS as an inspiration. This group quickly grew as people from Sun Microsystems, Microsoft and other companies started to join.\nThe Unicode Consortium which was incorporated in early 1991 published the first volume of the Unicode Standard later that year and the second volume in the next year to include a total of 28,327 characters.\nEncoding, Code Pages and Unicode for Programmers Now that the history class is over we can look at some code.\nWindows API If you ever wrote some C/C++ code and had to work with the Windows API you might wonder why there are multiple versions of the same function like MessageBox, MessageBoxA and MessageBoxW:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 int MessageBoxA(HWND hWnd, LPCSTR lpText, LPCSTR lpCaption, UINT uType); int MessageBoxW(HWND hWnd, LPCWSTR lpText, LPCWSTR lpCaption, UINT uType); #ifdef UNICODE #define MessageBox MessageBoxW #else #define MessageBox MessageBoxA #endif The docs say A means ANSI and the W stands for Unicode, but this is a bit misleading so here is an explanation.\nFirst ANSI is just straight up confusing and a \u0026ldquo;misnomer\u0026rdquo;.\nA misnomer is a name that is incorrectly or unsuitably applied.\nMicrosoft themselves said it\u0026rsquo;s stupid:\nANSI: Acronym for the American National Standards Institute. The term “ANSI” as used to signify Windows code pages is a historical reference, but is nowadays a misnomer that continues to persist in the Windows community. The source of this comes from the fact that the Windows code page 1252 was originally based on an ANSI draft—which became International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 8859-1. “ANSI applications” are usually a reference to non-Unicode or code page–based applications.\nSo going forward I\u0026rsquo;m just going to call it \u0026ldquo;Windows Code Pages\u0026rdquo;.\nNext up is the W for Unicode. The W comes from wchar_t which is an implementation-defined wide character type. In the Microsoft compiler, it represents a 16-bit wide character used to store Unicode encoded as UTF-16LE.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s recap:\nMessageBoxA: accepts the 8-bit char type and uses the Windows Code Pages MessageBoxW: accepts the implementation-defined wide wchar_t type and uses UTF-16 MessageBox: just an alias that will use either MessageBoxA or MessageBoxW The fact that wchar_t is implementation-defined is obviously a problem. Windows adopted Unicode when it fit in a 16-bit long type, but that is not the case anymore.\nNow for some code and some experiments:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN #include \u0026lt;iostream\u0026gt; #include \u0026#34;Windows.h\u0026#34; int main() { MessageBoxA(nullptr, \u0026#34;This uses Windows Code Pages\u0026#34;, nullptr, MB_OK); MessageBoxW(nullptr, L\u0026#34;This uses UTF-16\u0026#34;, nullptr, MB_OK); constexpr char helloShiftJis[] = {static_cast\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;(0x82), static_cast\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;(0xB1), static_cast\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;(0x82), static_cast\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;(0xF1), static_cast\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;(0x82), static_cast\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;(0xC9), static_cast\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;(0x82), static_cast\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;(0xBF), static_cast\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;(0x82), static_cast\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;(0xCD), \u0026#39;\\0\u0026#39;}; MessageBoxA(nullptr, helloShiftJis, nullptr, MB_OK); MessageBoxW(nullptr, L\u0026#34;こんにちは\u0026#34;, nullptr, MB_OK); return 0; } The first two calls show what you\u0026rsquo;d expect to see as they only contain Latin characters. The other calls are more interesting. This hideous array initialization contains the bytes of \u0026ldquo;こんにちは\u0026rdquo; encoded in Shift-JIS. My system locale is set to \u0026ldquo;English (United States)\u0026rdquo; which means my Windows uses Code Page 1252 aka windows-1252. This Code Page does not contain any of the Hiragana characters and instead of seeing \u0026ldquo;こんにちは\u0026rdquo; on screen I get \u0026ldquo;‚±‚ñ‚É‚¿‚Í\u0026rdquo;. If change my system locale to \u0026ldquo;Japanese (Japan)\u0026rdquo; then Windows would use Shift-JIS aka windows-932 and display \u0026ldquo;こんにちは\u0026rdquo; correctly. The MessageBoxW call with L\u0026quot;こんにちは\u0026quot; correctly displays \u0026ldquo;こんにちは\u0026rdquo; because it\u0026rsquo;s UTF-16 encoded.\nThe Windows API also provides functions for converting between string types:\n1 2 3 4 5 // convert from a Code Page to UTF-16 int MultiByteToWideChar(UINT CodePage, dwFlags, LPCCH lpMultiByteStr, int cbMultiByte, LPWSTR lpWideCharStr, int cchWideChar); // convert from UTF-16 to a Code Page int WideCharToMultiByte(UINT CodePage, DWORD dwFlags, LPCWCH lpWideCharStr, int cchWideChar, LPSTR lpMultiByteStr, int cbMultiByte, LPCCH lpDefaultChar, LPBOOL lpUsedDefaultChar); With the first function we can convert our Shift-JIS encoded string into UTF-16 and correctly display it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 auto bufferSize = MultiByteToWideChar(932, MB_ERR_INVALID_CHARS, helloShiftJis, -1, nullptr, 0); auto converted = new wchar_t[bufferSize]; MultiByteToWideChar(932, MB_ERR_INVALID_CHARS, helloShiftJis, -1, converted, bufferSize); MessageBoxW(nullptr, converted, nullptr, MB_OK); Current Issues We have looked at the history of character encodings and some examples with the Windows API. Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to take a look the issues we still have.\nThe Web is united under UTF-8 with over 98% of all web pages using it. This is further enforced by standards like JSON which require UTF-8 encoding. As good as this is, the desktops are still far behind UTF-8 adoption.\nWindows started supporting UTF-8 with Windows XP but only since Windows 10 version 1903 is it the default character encoding for Notepad. These editors are the main culprits as they often default to the current Windows Code Page which makes sharing files internationally a pain.\nThankfully everything is starting to or already using UTF-8, newer languages like Go and Rust basically force you to use UTF-8 and even Microsoft said you should start using it.\nWindows Code Pages are legacy but because it\u0026rsquo;s still used in production we continue to have issues with character encoding.

I personally had to deal a lot with encoding issues as a lot of games I play come from Japan and don\u0026rsquo;t work on my machine without a locale emulator.\nI hope this answered some questions you might have around this topic. It is very complex and has a very long history, but this should give you a peak into the issues we still have.\n","permalink":"https://erri120.github.io/posts/2022-04-15/","summary":"An in-depth post detailing the origins of Unicode, Code Pages and Character Encodings.","title":"Everything about Unicode, Code Pages and Character Encoding"},{"content":"Edit (Sep 2022): Update 3.0 has made this post obsolete. This post was written before 3.0 and the proposed solution only works with earlier versions. This post remains available for the sake of preservation and because it\u0026rsquo;s funny reading the ramblings of an angry person.\nI love Anno 2070. The game released in 2011, and I bought the Königsedition, a special deluxe edition containing the base game, the Deep Ocean DLC, a poster and the entire soundtrack on 3 CDs, back in 2013. I played this game to death, it is my most played strategy game and I have often look back at the fun I had while playing. If you never played the game and went on Steam you might notice it has a Mixed rating. This might seem weird considering I just told you how awesome this game is. But the ratings reflect the current state very well: you can\u0026rsquo;t fucking play the game.\nWhy the game is unplayable Did you think Cyberpunk 2077 at launch was bad with all the glitches and bugs? At least you could play that game and somewhat enjoy it. Now look at this 10-year-old game that you can\u0026rsquo;t even fucking play and Ubisoft completely abandoned it. A studio abandoning their games is nothing new and often not a problem. It might suck that the multiplayer servers of your favorite game go offline, but you could at least continue playing the campaign or the community might start hosting servers.\nSo what do I mean with \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t fucking play the game\u0026rdquo;? Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine an obstacle course where the finish is the main menu of the game. To get to the main menu you first have to start the game either through Uplay, Steam or by starting the Anno5.exe directly. The first obstacle is Uplay itself. I can not count the number of times Uplay had some error or bug that lead to me not playing a game. Back when Assassin\u0026rsquo;s Creed Unity came out, Uplay thought my saves were ephemeral, and I had to replay the first 5 hours of the game more than 13 times. The launcher is a complete dumpster fire and worse than the League of Legends client.\nIf you start Anno 2070 then Uplay will also launch and probably kill the process and start the Auto Updater. If that happens you are fucked because now the \u0026ldquo;Auto Updater\u0026rdquo; will try to auto update your game, even though it\u0026rsquo;s already updated. Once it\u0026rsquo;s done updating it will start the game which will start Uplay which will probably start the updater again. If you bought the game on Steam then you have to flip a coin and if it lands on heads you are fucked and Uplay doesn\u0026rsquo;t think you own the game. If you somehow did manage to convince Uplay to work for once you are now faced with the login screen.\nThe login screen: You open a website, click the login button, enter your username + password and log in to your account. But why do you have to log in to your account in Anno 2070? Some time around 2013 Ubisoft had the genius idea of switching up their entire account system. Anno 2070 was caught up in the transition and somehow came out as an abomination where the login is more broken than Fallout 76 on release. So what username + password do you use in Anno 2070? If you think you have to use your Uplay account then you\u0026rsquo;re wrong. If you choose your Steam credentials then you are also wrong. You have to use the credentials of the account you used to register the game. In my case it\u0026rsquo;s not my main Uplay account because it didn\u0026rsquo;t even exist back then. Now here is the fun part: I still own the game on Uplay. It is in my library, but I can\u0026rsquo;t use my account because the key is not linked to my actual Uplay account. I put emphasis on key because that is our next hurdle. Even if you manage to log in you will probably be asked about the key however your key might be linked to another account even though that account doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the game in their Uplay library. I don\u0026rsquo;t even know how this exactly works with Steam users, but I can imagine it doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nI hope you come to understand how utterly broken the start procedure of Anno 2070 is. Back in the day when Ubisoft used something called SolidShield the process was even more fucked. Your key was not only tied to some random account but also to your hardware directly meaning if you upgraded your GTX 580 to a GTX 590 your key would not work. If you somehow think this is just the rambling of an insane person then you are correct, but I would also like you to check out the Steam reviews and this great post on reddit \u0026ldquo;Ubisoft\u0026rsquo;s Anno 2070 Unplayable Due to DRM\u0026rdquo; for more salt.\nFixing the game Edit (Dec 2021): Before we dive into this I want to tell you that there are other potential fixes to this problem. Some people messaged me and asks why I didn\u0026rsquo;t do X or Y and my answer was always \u0026ldquo;It didn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rdquo;. If you have a similar problem with Anno 2070 then there are other solutions you can try. The fix I will propose is guaranteed to work but should be a last resort.\nNow that I cooled off and finished my rant it\u0026rsquo;s time to talk about how we can fix everything. If you want to follow along you need to get the latest version from Uplay or Steam. It has the version number 2.0.7792.0 and the SHA256 hash of Anno5.exe is C76D42E71AF6A7D1786C6846091A5FBDDB13E3A88A72E469F36F9F365645D58A. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want an explanation of how I got here you can skip to the TL;DR but if you want to hear the explanation then knowing assembly and basic programming is recommended.\nThe goal is to force the game into offline mode. Simply changing your firewall settings to block all connections from the executable is not the solution because, as explained earlier, we also need to deal with Uplay. There is actually a single function responsible for launching Uplay. The standard solution would be to either replace the function with NOP instructions or replace the CALL instruction with NOP. This would probably work, however I found something better. This InitializeUplay function gets called only once: during a pre-init function of the game inside a condition. There is actually a JNZ instruction which will skip the function call entirely.\nThe comparison at 004b05bf (80 7e 50 00 bb 10 00 00 00) compares whatever is at ESI+50 with 0 meaning that the JNZ jump at 004b05c8 will be taken if ESI+50 is not 0. This is never the case and I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand what the condition actually represents, but we can exploit this and make sure the jump is always taken. Since ESI+50 is always 0 we can just change the comparison to compare ESI+50 with 1: 80 7e 50 01. With this you can launch the game and Uplay will never start.\nNext up is the login screen. This took me the longest to figure out. I found the Uplay initialization within a few hours, but this took me an entire day. We can\u0026rsquo;t really skip the login screen, trust me I tried that, but instead we just have to trick the game that we are offline and want to play in offline mode. I used to play a lot in offline and back in the day you still had to put your username + password and click login at which point the game will see you are offline and then loads your offline profile. So now it\u0026rsquo;s time to find the callback function of the login button. I did manage to find the callback function and noticed a little function that returns a WebAdapter based on the argument. Let\u0026rsquo;s name this function CreateWebAdapter(int x) with x = 0 returning an offline web adapter and x = 1 the normal one.\nMy spidey senses were tingling, and I knew this was related to the solution. The login button callback function however will always call CreateWebAdapter(1). You could change the 1 to a 0, but I noticed something different. You see, the login frame is created programmatically, and you can clearly see where the username text box, password text box, remember user ID checkbox, register account button and login button get added to the frame. In order to figure out which button has what callback I put a breakpoint on every callback function and clicked every button. However, there was 1 unused button. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s unused or only conditionally used but guess what function the callback calls: CreateWebAdapter(0). This possibly unused callback function was very similar to the login button callback, but it will always use the offline web adapter. I was very excited when I found out about this and immediately changed the callback function of the login button to use the callback function of the unused button by changing the PUSH instruction at 0068a57b from 68 90 9c 68 00 to 68 d0 8f 68 00, and it fucking worked. You can now log in and start in offline mode.\nAnno 2070 Main Menu\nTL;DR if you don\u0026rsquo;t want an explanation Change the CMP instruction at 004b05bf (80 7e 50 00 bb 10 00 00 00) from 80 7e 50 00 to 80 7e 50 01 Change the PUSH instruction at 0068a57b from 68 90 9c 68 00 to 68 d0 8f 68 00 If you did everything right the SHA256 hash of the modified Anno5.exe file should be 01E123A72C3DCB4FB1E018A685692F57B9586FF4F187BB23B09D8B93D754C268. If that is not the case you did something wrong and your game is probably broken so load your backup and try again.\nAnno 2070 setting tips In case you want to play Anno 2070 after reading this post here are some changes you might want to make in your settings file. The file is located in %appdata%/Ubisoft/Anno 2070/Config/Engine.ini\nchange language by editing \u0026lt;LanguageTAG\u0026gt;ger\u0026lt;/LanguageTAG\u0026gt; skip the intro with \u0026lt;SkipIntro\u0026gt;1\u0026lt;/SkipIntro\u0026gt; Afterword This project has been a lot of fun and ended rather suddenly. I initially allotted 3 full days to this endeavor, but I kept finding new leads and getting new ideas, so I ended up only spending around 12.5 hours (I love how x32dbg will tell you how much time you have wasted debugging). The solution is also very simple, and I made it the title of this post. Just 3 bytes to fix the entire start of the game. I thought I would have to modify a lot of functions or write some DLL I\u0026rsquo;d have to inject but no, you just change 3 bytes and be happy :)\nI hope you found this post somewhat interesting, and maybe you can finally play Anno 2070.

I used C++ for 1.x because I wanted to finally build something with this language. I had only done small assignments in Uni with C++ but never done anything more with it, mainly because the language sucks ass.\nC/C++ is old, very old, and it clearly shows, not just in the language but the tooling available. Ask 20 C++ developers what build system they use, and you will likely get 10 different answers. Working with dependencies is a nightmare when it comes to C/C++ development. It\u0026rsquo;s actually impossible to count the amount of times I wanted to contribute to a C++ project only to be blocked by some weird build system that only works in a specific environment when the stars align and the moon is in the Waxing Gibbous lunar phase. Once you did get something to work you now have to deal with the language itself. Let me ask you this: how do you represent a string in C++? Did you know that there is std::string which is actually just std::basic_string\u0026lt;char\u0026gt;, std::u16string which is std::basic_string\u0026lt;char16_t\u0026gt;, std::u32string which is std::basic_string\u0026lt;char32_t\u0026gt; and std::wstring which is std::basic_string\u0026lt;wchar_t\u0026gt; but don\u0026rsquo;t let that fool you because there is also char8_t from C++ 20 that introduces std::u8string and don\u0026rsquo;t forget that wchar_t has different sizes depending on the platform, compiler and time of day?\nC++ is a fucking mess. Working with strings in C++ should not be this hard.\nSo lets calm down and look at something different: Rust. I love Rust, it\u0026rsquo;s C++ in way better and more modern. I wanted to rework rpgmpacker in Rust and actually did exactly that for quite some time but soon realized this was also not the way.\nRPG Maker MV/MZ is pure JavaScript with the data files being in JSON. The developers are probably familiar with JavaScript as well so considering the ecosystem, it is more fitting to create a JavaScript tool. Of course, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be doing that, fuck vanilla JavaScript, I\u0026rsquo;m using TypeScript.\nI like to use the right tool for the job. Even though I\u0026rsquo;m quite the C# and Rust fanatic I went with TypeScript because it makes life very easy. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to write complex JSON parsers or DTOs, I can just do JSON.parse(...) and access whatever I want. One huge problem was also parsing the plugins for the exclude-unused feature. If you open js/plugins.js in your game, you will find a variable $plugins. With TypeScript I can just use the VM to dynamically load this file and access this variable directly. With any other language I would have to read the file as a string and do some complex string parsing.\nOf course there are some problems with TypeScript. I previously complained about the C++ dependency systems but the huge dependency trees you can get when using NPM are also insane. Before I even started on the rework I set my goal to require the least amount of modules which ended up being only 1: yargs because parsing arguments is not something I want to implement myself.\nI hope the rework will be received pleasantly by the 2 people using the tool.\n","permalink":"https://erri120.github.io/posts/2021-11-18/","summary":"A quick post explaining my decision of moving from C++ to TypeScript for my project rpgmpacker.","title":"Reworking rpgmpacker: Moving from C++ to TypeScript"},{"content":"Time and Frames We have all heard the term FPS, frames per second, which tells us how many frames are rendered on screen within one second. Higher FPS will result in smoother animations because those animations get more frames. The problem with high FPS is that the GPU has to keep up with this demand and be able to produce 30/60/144 or more frames within 1 second. This is where frame times, VSync and a bunch of offer stuff that I won\u0026rsquo;t cover here comes into play.\nThe important takeaway is that you can not reliably calculate a duration based on how many frames where rendered because not every frame takes the same amount of time. This is a problem when you want to smoothly move an object from one position to another. Engines like Unity solve this by providing a delta time which is the interval from the last to the current frame, allowing you to create smooth translations.\nLooking at RPG Maker MV/MZ So what issue does RPG Maker have? I have recently played a game for around 21 hours, but the save menu displayed over 51 hours, more than double. Actually not just more than double but around 2.4 times more than expected. This quickly made me realize that I had been playing the game on my 144Hz monitor, meaning instead of rendering at 60 FPS, the game was rendering at 144 FPS. I hope you notice that 60 x 2.4 equals 144.\nTo further investigate the problem I took a peek inside the js folder, did a quick search for \u0026ldquo;playtime\u0026rdquo; and found the culprits of my frustration:\n1 2 3 4 Game_System.prototype.onBeforeSave = function() { this._framesOnSave = Graphics.frameCount; // ... }; 1 2 3 4 Game_System.prototype.onAfterLoad = function() { Graphics.frameCount = this._framesOnSave; // ... }; 1 2 3 Game_System.prototype.playtime = function() { return Math.floor(Graphics.frameCount / 60); }; 1 2 3 4 5 6 Game_System.prototype.playtimeText = function() { var hour = Math.floor(this.playtime() / 60 / 60); var min = Math.floor(this.playtime() / 60) % 60; var sec = this.playtime() % 60; return hour.padZero(2) + \u0026#39;:\u0026#39; + min.padZero(2) + \u0026#39;:\u0026#39; + sec.padZero(2); }; A quick explanation: whenever you save, the game includes the amount of frames it has rendered in the save file because Game_System is serialized and _framesOnSave is a field of that object. When you load, the save will get deserialized and Graphics.frameCount will be set back to that value. In case you are wondering: Graphics.frameCount gets incremented on each render.\nThis is fine so far, but the real problems are found in the playtime and playtimeText functions where the game assumes you are constantly playing at 60 frames per second. The pure frameCount value gets divided by 60 to get the amount of seconds passed and in playtimeText that result is further processed to the get hours and minutes.\nDue to the multiple issues outlined at the beginning you can see that this is not a good idea. Having said that: let\u0026rsquo;s look at how to fix this.\nPossible Solution This solution is probably the easiest and most straightforward one I can think of:\non load/start: set startTime to the current time on save: get the current time and calculate the difference between now and startTime add the difference to a variable in the save No need for frame count calculations or anything complex, just use Date.now() a few times and get the difference.\nChanging the implementation in RPG Maker MV/MZ Start by opening js/rpg_objects.js and look for the initialize function. Here we want to add two new fields:\n1 2 3 4 5 Game_System.prototype.initialize = function() { this._startTime = Date.now(); this._playtime = 0; // ... } Date.now() returns the current Unix time as an integer that looks like this: 1632928643900.\nWe need to set the start time in the initialize function for when the game starts and in the onAfterLoad function for when the player loads a save file:\n1 2 3 4 Game_System.prototype.onAfterLoad = function() { this._startTime = Date.now(); // ... } The onBeforeSave function gets called before the save is serialized so here we have to calculate the time difference and reset the start time:\n1 2 3 4 5 Game_System.prototype.onBeforeSave = function() { this._playtime += Date.now() - this._startTime; this._startTime = Date.now(); // ... } Assuming the player started at 1632928643900 and played for 1 second till 1632928644900, this._playtime will now be 1000. The only thing remaining is updating the playtime function:\n1 2 3 Game_System.prototype.playtime = function() { return Math.floor(this._playtime / 1000); }; Since this function returns the amount of time passed in seconds we have to divide by 1000 to convert from milliseconds to seconds. While we are at it, I also recommend updating playtimeText:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Game_System.prototype.playtimeText = function() { var secondsPassed = this.playtime(); var minutesPassed = Math.floor(secondsPassed / 60); var hoursPassed = Math.floor(minutesPassed / 60); var sec = secondsPassed % 60; var min = minutesPassed % 60; var hour = hoursPassed % 24; return hour.padZero(2) + \u0026#39;:\u0026#39; + min.padZero(2) + \u0026#39;:\u0026#39; + sec.padZero(2); }; The main difference here is that we cache the result from the playtime function and other operations.\nPlugin for MV/MZ If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to mess with the game files directly, which is a good idea, then I suggest taking a look at the PlaytimeFix plugin which I developed that does everything explained in this post.\nAfterword This issue has been bugging me a lot during my playthroughs of longer games because you don\u0026rsquo;t really notice it when your playtime goes from 1h to 2 hours but going from 21 hours to 50+ hours was a bit more in my face. RPG Maker MZ also doesn\u0026rsquo;t fix this, and I have not seen any discussion about this.\n","permalink":"https://erri120.github.io/posts/2021-09-29/","summary":"RPG Maker MV/MZ uses the amount of rendered frames to calculate how long player has been playing the game.

However, you have to ask yourself if it\u0026rsquo;s worth spending hours writing a complex and long script. In the worst case you might end up wasting instead of saving time. Thankfully most programming related tasks can be automated very quickly and each language or framework often has documentation on how to get you up and running.\nThis is sadly not often the case when it comes to game development. Popular engines like Unreal Engine and Unity have automation tools1 and documentation for automating the build process but less popular ones such as RPG Maker don\u0026rsquo;t have those.\nIn this post I will explain what CI/CD means and how to set up a pipeline for RPG Maker MV/MZ with rpgmpacker. A big chunk of this post is explaining CI/CD and how RPG Maker MV/MZ works, if you just want to go to the practical part click here.\nCI/CD for non-programmers RPG Maker is very non-programmer friendly, and you can easily end up not having to write a single line of code when creating a game with it. For this reason I want to make sure we all have the same base level understanding of CI/CD before continuing. That being said, I expect you to know about version control with git so make sure to watch these two amazing videos by Fireship if you are unfamiliar with it:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started with Continuous Integration which means running a pipeline on every change you commit to a repository. This pipeline consists of one or multiple jobs where one job could be running some tests or building the project. If you run the tests on every change then you can easily track down the commit where a bug was introduced to the codebase. A common pipeline would look like this:\nsetup (checkout, getting all the tools) running tests building the project packaging uploading an artifact (fancy word for an archive containing the output) The terminology can be different depending on your provider for example a pipeline on GitHub is called a workflow and each workflow has steps instead of jobs. They often mean the same thing so don\u0026rsquo;t let that confuse you.\nContinuous Delivery is about delivering the artifact we produced previously. This artifact can be sent to testers, friends or the QA team. Continuous Deployment is also a thing and means actually deploying the artifact by uploading the next release of a game to itch.io or deploying the software to your servers.\nBig studios often end up with huge pipelines because they have many employees and teams. They might have a CI pipeline that runs the tests and builds the project. The artifact would then send in a CD pipeline to the testers or QA team and when they approve of the build it gets released into the world. This is probably not the case for you or your team and most of the time you can combine all of this into one pipeline.\nIf you are curious how such a pipeline might look like, here is the GitHub Actions workflow file that builds (CI) and deploys (CD) this site to GitHub Pages on every push to the master branch:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 on: push: branches: [ master ] jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: # setup - uses: actions/checkout@v2 with: submodules: true fetch-depth: 0 - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#39;latest\u0026#39; # building the site (CI) - name: Build run: hugo --minify # deploying the site (CD) - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} publish_dir: ./public publish_branch: gh-pages RPG Maker MV/MZ manual export RPG Maker MV Deployment Window\nThis is the deployment window of RPG Maker MV which you can access in the editor under File -\u0026gt; Deployment. The major issue with this is the fact you have to use it at all. Software developers love the tools they can use from the command line because they can be easily accessed using a script.\nOther engines like Unreal Engine have to compile code before deployment, but RPG Maker is very different: It\u0026rsquo;s only copying files from one place to another.\nThere is no code to compile because all the code is in JavaScript, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t even need to compile an executable because it just uses NW.js. RPG Maker is one of the simplest game engines, not just in terms of usability but how everything is just JSON and JavaScript. You can literally go into the js folder and look at all the source code of the engine. All the data is saved as JSON so if you want to change the name of an item you can open data/Items.json and change the values.\nIf you are curious where all those files come from, open your RPG Maker MV/MZ installation folder and look for folders that start with nw-js-. The files inside those folders are copied over to the output directory. You can also find the default template files in the NewData folders.\nSimply copying files from one place to another can be done with a script. This was exactly what rpgmpacker did in my first prototype, but I soon realized that there was more going on.\nFirst we have file filtering. For audio, you can have .ogg and .m4a files but exporting for Windows/OSX will only copy the .ogg files while exporting for Mobile will only copy .m4a files. Then we have image and audio \u0026ldquo;encryption\u0026rdquo; and the exclude-unused feature which requires parsing of almost all JSON files to figure out which files are actually in use and which are not. There is even more to this which can\u0026rsquo;t be done in a simple script, so I decided to build an entire tool which we are going to use in the pipeline.\nCreating a Release Pipeline for RPG Maker The pipeline we are going to build will do the following:\nrun rpgmpacker zip the output upload the output to itch.io using Butler If your game is not on itch.io then you can leave out the last step or replace it with an upload to MEGA, GDrive or your hosting platform of choice.\nFor the pipeline you can write a Bash or PowerShell script, just pick whatever you like more:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 #!/bin/bash INPUT=\u0026#34;./MyProject\u0026#34; OUTPUT=\u0026#34;./build\u0026#34; RPGMAKER=\u0026#34;M:\\\\SteamLibrary\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\RPG Maker MV\u0026#34; npx rpgmpacker@latest \\ --input \u0026#34;$INPUT\u0026#34; \\ --output \u0026#34;$OUTPUT\u0026#34; \\ --rpgmaker \u0026#34;$RPGMAKER\u0026#34; \\ --exclude \\ --noempty \\ --debug \\ --platforms \u0026#34;Windows\u0026#34; \u0026#34;OSX\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Linux\u0026#34; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 $PROJECT=\u0026#34;./MyProject\u0026#34; $OUTPUT=\u0026#34;./build\u0026#34; $RPGMAKER=\u0026#34;M:\\\\SteamLibrary\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\RPG Maker MV\u0026#34; npx rpgmpacker@latest ` --input $PROJECT ` --output $OUTPUT ` --rpgmaker $RPGMAKER ` --exclude ` --noempty ` --debug ` --platforms \u0026#34;Windows\u0026#34; \u0026#34;OSX\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Linux\u0026#34; In my case I have the project in a folder called MyProject next to the script and the output should go into the build folder. I\u0026rsquo;m using the Steam version of RPG Maker MV for this but any version of MV or MZ can be used.\nNext up we want to zip the output. rpgmpacker will create an output folder for each platform you specified so for me I will have build/Windows, build/OSX and a build/Linux folder.\n1 2 3 for platform in $OUTPUT/*; do 7z a -tzip -o$OUTPUT $platform.zip $platform/* done 1 2 3 4 $Platforms = Get-ChildItem -Path $OUTPUT -Directory -Name foreach ($platform in $Platforms) { 7z a -tzip -o$OUTPUT $OUTPUT/$platform.zip $OUTPUT/$platform/* } This is where the difference between PowerShell and Bash start to appear. In Bash, we use a glob to get all top-level items of the output directory and in PowerShell we use the Get-ChildItem function. They look different, but they do the same thing with the main difference being that platform in Bash will be ./build/Windows while $platform in PowerShell will be just Windows. This is why we need to prefix $platform with $OUTPUT/ when calling 7z.\nThe pipeline is almost done at this point. Next is publishing the output with Butler to itch.io but if you are not using that platform you are now done.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 # see https://broth.itch.ovh/butler ButlerChannel=\u0026#34;windows-amd64\u0026#34; # darwin-amd64 for Mac and linux-amd64 for Linux ButlerVersion=\u0026#34;15.21.0\u0026#34; ButlerOutput=\u0026#34;butler-$ButlerVersion-$ButlerChannel\u0026#34; if [ ! -d $ButlerOutput ]; then curl -L -o butler.zip https://broth.itch.ovh/butler/$butlerChannel/$butlerVersion/archive/default unzip -o butler.zip -d $ButlerOutput rm butler.zip else echo \u0026#34;Butler version $ButlerVersion ($ButlerChannel) has already been downloaded\u0026#34; fi # change butler.exe to just butler if you are on Unix butler=\u0026#34;$ButlerOutput/butler.exe\u0026#34; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 # see https://broth.itch.ovh/butler $ButlerChannel=\u0026#34;windows-amd64\u0026#34; # darwin-amd64 for Mac and linux-amd64 for Linux $ButlerVersion=\u0026#34;15.21.0\u0026#34; $ButlerOutput=\u0026#34;butler-$ButlerVersion-$ButlerChannel\u0026#34; if (![System.IO.Directory]::Exists($ButlerOutput)) { Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile butler.zip \u0026#34;https://broth.itch.ovh/butler/$butlerChannel/$butlerVersion/archive/default\u0026#34; Expand-Archive -Path butler.zip $ButlerOutput Remove-Item -Path butler.zip } else { Write-Output \u0026#34;Butler version $ButlerVersion ($ButlerChannel) has already been downloaded\u0026#34; } # change butler.exe to just butler if you are on Unix $butler=\u0026#34;$ButlerOutput/butler.exe\u0026#34; If you are not on Windows you should change the ButlerChannel variable to darwin-amd64 or linux-amd64 depending on your system. I recommend checking the channel list of Butler if you need something different. I\u0026rsquo;ve added a simple check, so we don\u0026rsquo;t download Butler whenever we call the script. Before we continue you should get an API key from itch.io. You should treat API keys like passwords and should never make them public. A good way of storing API keys is with environment variables and Butler expects the API key to be stored in the BUTLER_API_KEY environment variable.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 export BUTLER_API_KEY=\u0026#34;YOUR_KEY\u0026#34; ButlerProject=\u0026#34;YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME\u0026#34; ./$butler login ./$butler push $OUTPUT/Windows $ButlerProject:windows-beta ./$butler push $OUTPUT/OSX $ButlerProject:osx-beta ./$butler push $OUTPUT/Linux $ButlerProject:linux-beta 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $env:BUTLER_API_KEY=\u0026#34;YOUR_KEY\u0026#34; $ButlerProject=\u0026#34;YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME\u0026#34; \u0026amp;$butler login \u0026amp;$butler push $OUTPUT/Windows.zip \u0026#34;${ButlerProject}:windows-beta\u0026#34; \u0026amp;$butler push $OUTPUT/OSX.zip \u0026#34;${ButlerProject}:osx-beta\u0026#34; \u0026amp;$butler push $OUTPUT/Linux.zip \u0026#34;${ButlerProject}:linux-beta\u0026#34; I recommend that you look at the Butler Docs for the different channels you can push to.
